Q100698525,Bringing Out the Dead,Joe Connelly,1998,271,1125,10,3.7,"Perhaps only someone who has worked for almost a decade as a medic in New York City's Hell's Kitchen - as Joe Connelly has - could write a novel as riveting and fiercely authentic as <i>Bringing Out the Dead</i>. Like a front-line reporter, Connelly writes from deep within the experience, and the result is a debut novel of extraordinary power and intensity.<br /><br />In Frank Pierce, a brash EMS medic working the streets of Hell's Kitchen, Connelly gives us a man who is being destroyed by the act of saving people. Addicted to the thrill (""the best drug in the world"") and the mission of the job, Frank is nevertheless drowning in five years' worth of grief and guilt - his own and others': ""My primary role was less about saving lives than about bearing witness."" His wife has left him, he's drinking on the job, and just a month ago he ""helped to kill"" an eighteen-year-old asthmatic girl. Now she's become the waking nightmare of all his failures: hallucination and projection (""The ghosts that once visited my dreams had followed me out to the street and were now talking back""), and as a real to him as his own skin. And in reaction to her death Frank has desperately resurrected a patient back into a life now little better than death.<br /><br />In a narrative that moves with the furious energy of an ambulance run, we follow Frank through two days and nights: into the excitement and dread of the calls; the mad humour that keeps the medics afloat; the memories, distant and recent, through which Frank reminds himself why he became a medic and tries, in vain, to convince himself to give it up. And we are with him as he faces his newest ghost: the resurrected patient, whose demands to be released into death might be the most sensible thing Frank has heard in months, if only he would listen.<br /><br /><i>Bringing Out the Dead</i> is a stunning novel."

Carefully (and also illegally), he tapped into the main irrigation channel. And so began-though few knew it at the time-the Milagro beanfield war. But like everything else in the dirt-poor town of Milagro, it would be a patchwork war, fought more by tactical retreats than by battlefield victories. Gradually, the small farmers and sheepmen begin to rally to Joe's beanfield as the symbol of their lost rights and their lost lands. And downstate in the capital, the Anglo water barons and power brokers huddle in urgent conference, intent on destroying that symbol before it destroys their multimillion-dollar land-development schemes. The tale of Milagro's rising is wildly comic and lovingly ter, a vivid portrayal of a town that, half-stumbling and partly prodded, gropes its way toward its own stubborn salvation.<br /></div>"

Q1053313,Jerusalem Delivered,Torquato Tasso,2000,508,1038,32,3.875,"Arguably the greatest Italian poet after Dante, Torquato Tasso was born in Sorrento in 1544 and died in Rome in 1595, having served as the court poet in Ferrara, been confined for years in a madhouse after attacking a servant with a knife, and composed one of the great works of Renaissance literature. <br /><br />Unjustly neglected today, Tasso's epic poem 'Jerusalem Delivered'(first published in 1581) is set in the 11th century and tells the story of the First Crusade and the siege which gave Christian armies control over Jerusalem and the Holy Lands for a time.<br /><br />As in other epic poems, 'Jerusalem Delivered' deftly mixes history and myth. Tasso's heroes - Godfrey, leader of the Christian armies; Rinaldo, bravest of the Christian warriors; and Tancred, the Italian prince who falls in love with the pagan warrioress Clorinda, whom he eventually (and<br />simultaneously) converts and kills - must face not only the Saracens and their allies, but also a host of fearsome and manipulative devils, demons, and sorcerers. <br /><br />This is a sweeping and often thrilling tale of war, faith, love, and sex that easily rivals its classical predecessors. Writing at a time when Christianity was bitterly divided, Tasso was naturally concerned with the nature of leadership and loyalty, with the importance of sacrifice, with the evils of corruption, and with the existence of truth, themes that continue to resonate today. <br /><br />No wonder that for three centuries, 'Jerusalem Delivered' was considered the great modern epic. Indeed, Spenser borrowed scenes and episodes from this poem in writing the 'Faerie Queen', and Milton was greatly influenced by Tasso when writing his own Christian epic, 'Paradise Lost'.<br /><br />English-language readers who are familiar with Tasso's grand romance have until now known it only through a verse translation by English poet Edward Fairfax published in 1600. In order to fit Tasso's stanzas into the then popular Spenserian verse form, Fairfax had to alter the original poem considerably. <br /><br />Now, 400 years later, Anthony Esolen presents a new translation that transforms 'Jerusalem Delivered' into an English-language masterpiece. The first major verse translation into English since Fairfax's, Esolen's version is both more true to its original source and more fluid than that of his<br />Elizabethan predecessor. <br /><br />Esolen has translated 'Jerusalem Delivered' with the care of poet, capturing the delight of Tasso's descriptions, the different voices of its cast of characters, the shadings<br />between glory and tragedy, and does them all in an English as powerful as Tasso's Italian. <br /><br />Esolen's will immediately be acclaimed as the definitive translation of this powerful work of faith and war. Like the<br />Fagles 'Iliad' and 'Odyssey', the Pinsky 'Inferno', and Seamus Heaney's imaginative new rendering of 'Beowulf', Anthony Esolen's bold, fast-moving, and faithful translation of Tasso's<br />Crusade-era adventure will introduce a new generation of readers to a masterpiece of world literature."

In this wry first-person narrative, Ingemar tells of his life with his aunt and uncle in Småland, where he goes to live off and on for two years, one before and one after his mother’s death.<br /><br />In Småland, Ingemar finds more of a family than he’s ever known, as well as a cast of comic village eccentrics, with whom he decides he fits in perfectly. There’s the tomboy Saga, who teaches him how to box and introduces him to the mysteries of female adolescence; and Manne, who has green hair because his inventor grandfather makes him bathe in a copper tub. Together with the people of Småland, we watch as Ingemar falls into one outrageous situation after another, always displaying irresistible humour and the fortitude of a true hero.<br /><br />In turns tragic and farcical, and imbued with an acute sense of the absurd, Ingemar’s story is one of a valiant, wacky, and often hilarious struggle to make sense of life and of his mother’s illness.<br />"

Q1072975,The Housekeeper and the Professor,Yōko Ogawa,2009,180,31006,3936,3.96,"He is a brilliant math Professor with a peculiar problem--ever since a traumatic head injury, he has lived with only eighty minutes of short-term memory. <br /><br />She is an astute young Housekeeper, with a ten-year-old son, who is hired to care for him. <br /><br />And every morning, as the Professor and the Housekeeper are introduced to each other anew, a strange and beautiful relationship blossoms between them. Though he cannot hold memories for long (his brain is like a tape that begins to erase itself every eighty minutes), the Professor’s mind is still alive with elegant equations from the past. And the numbers, in all of their articulate order, reveal a sheltering and poetic world to both the Housekeeper and her young son. The Professor is capable of discovering connections between the simplest of quantities--like the Housekeeper’s shoe size--and the universe at large, drawing their lives ever closer and more profoundly together, even as his memory slips away. <br /><br />The Housekeeper and the Professor is an enchanting story about what it means to live in the present, and about the curious equations that can create a family."

Q108464841,The Old Garden,Hwang Sok-yong,2009,480,159,13,3.92,"Political prisoner Hyun Woo is freed after eighteen years to find no trace of the world he knew. The friends with whom he shared utopianist dreams are gone. His Seoul is unrecognizably transformed and aggressively modernized. Yoon Hee, the woman he loved, died three years ago. A broken man, he drifts toward a small house in Kalmoe, where he and Yoon Hee once stole a few fleeting months of happiness while fleeing the authorities. In the company of her diaries, he relives and reviews his life, trying to find meaning in the revolutionary struggle that consumed their youth-a youth of great energy and optimism, victim to implacable history. Hyun Woo weighs the worth of his own life, spent in prison, and that of the strong-willed artist Yoon Hee, whose involvement in rebel groups took her to Berlin and the fall of the wall. With great poignancy, Hwang Sok-yong grapples with the immortal questions-the endurance of love, the price of a commitment to causes-while depicting a generation that sacrifi ced youth, liberty, and often life, for the dream of a better tomorrow. Born in 1943, Hwang Sok-yong is a Korean writer of world renown and the recipient of numerous international awards and honors. His work, which grapples with the troubled recent history of his divided country, has been the cause of his imprisonment, his exile, and finally that rare achievement of a wide readership and appreciation in both North and South Korea. The Old Garden is, by the author's own admission, his most deeply auto biographical work."

Q113528605,Captain Bligh And Mr. Christian: The Men And The Mutiny,Richard Hough,1979,320,98,12,4.0,"The mutiny on the Bounty has fascinated readers for more than two hundred years, but no other book on this extraordinary episode in maritime history tells the story as well as this masterly and thrilling account by Richard Hough. He has set down all the aspects of the extraordinary story in a manner that is utterly compelling, and he has brought alive the powerful characters who played out the events. Highly touted when first published in 1972, it is an epic drama of courage, discovery, deceit, and treachery. The story of Fletcher Christian and the rest of the mutineers' discovery of an uninhabited island and their attempt to fashion a community away from the pursuing ships of the Royal Navy is as tense as it is horrific. Captain Bligh's remarkable 3,600-mile voyage to Timor in the ship's open launch is fully described as one of the great feats of navigation. The dismal episode of the Pandora and the remarkable survival of one of the mutineers add further fascinating twists to the story."

Two Millennium journalists about to expose the truth about the sex trade in Sweden are brutally murdered, and Salander’s prints are on the weapon. Her history of unpredictable and vengeful behaviour makes her an official danger to society - but no-one can find her anywhere.<br />Meanwhile, Mikael Blomkvist, editor-in-chief of Millennium, will not believe what he hears on the news. Knowing Salander to be fierce when fearful, he is desperate to get to her before she is cornered and alone. As he fits the pieces of the puzzle together, he comes up against some hardened criminals, including the chainsaw-wielding ‘blond giant’ - a fearsomely huge thug who can feel no pain.

Committed to psychiatric care aged 12, declared legally incompetent at 18, this is a messed-up young woman who is the product of an unjust and corrupt system.

It began as a simple Cow meets Bull story: he was the young producer with the washboard stomach and the J-Crew good-looks, she the co-worker with her heart on the shelf.

So Jane Goodall, with the help of Freud, Darwin, and her own menagerie of lovelorn friends--a broken-hearted womanizer named Eddie, her best friend Joan, who for the past two years has been dating her boss, a man engaged to another woman, and David, who shares with Jane both a taste for good-looking men and a terminal case of bad luck--delves into the mystery of the male animal."

That’s just what Luther and Nora Krank have in mind when they decide that, just this once, they’ll skip the holiday altogether. Theirs will be the only house on Hemlock Street without a rooftop Frosty; they won’t be hosting their annual Christmas Eve bash; they aren’t even going to have a tree. They won’t need one, because come December 25 they’re setting sail on a Caribbean cruise. But, as this weary couple is about to discover, skipping Christmas brings enormous consequences–and isn’t half as easy as they’d imagined. <br /><br />A classic tale for modern times, <i>Skipping Christmas</i> offers a hilarious look at the chaos and frenzy that have become part of our holiday tradition."

Q1169793,Tobacco Road,Erskine Caldwell,1947,171,13605,561,3.73,"Enormously popular in the 1930s and 1940s, Erskine Caldwell brought to millions of Americans his bawdy, forcefully written, grimly comic stories of injustice and human irrationality, set chiefly in the South. ""Tobacco Road"" remains the book for which he is best remembered. <br />Jeeter Lester and his wife, Ada, live in a decaying cabin with his silent mother and two of their fifteen children, the hare-lipped Ellie May and her sixteen-year-old brother Dude. When Lov Bensey, married to Jeeter's twelve-year-old daughter, arrives to seek his father-in-law's help in getting his child-wife to speak to him and sleep with him, Jeeter regards the visit as an opportunity to steal the turnips Lov carries in his sack. Times are hard in Georgia and tenant farmers like Jeeter are unable to get the credit needed to acquire seed cotton and fertilizer, let alone money for food. <br />With a rich sense of folk humor and measured vulgarity, Caldwell continues the story of the Lesters: the diversional act of the disfigured Ellie May seducing Lov, allowing her family to steal the turnips; the widow of the local fundamentalist clergy, forty-year-old Sister Bessie Rice, believing that God has directed her to marry the simpleton Dude; and the starving of Jeeter's old, toothless mother. All are part of Caldwell's stark commentary on the social inequities facing these characters and the people like them living an abject existence."

Until a knock at the door shattered sanctuary.<br /><br />Rynn is the little girl who lives in the house at the end of the lane with her father-or so she says. No one had seen the poet, Leslie Jacobs, for a long time, and though the pungent aroma of Gauloise filled the parlor with intimations of his presence, no one was certain he was there:<br /><br />Not Mrs. Hallet, the real estate agent who'd rented the old house to the eminent English poet and his daughter and whose formidable manner, product of her impeccable Long Island lineage, brooked no betrayals, especially not from a thirteen-year-old...<br /><br />Not her son Frank, whose Halloween visit, intruding on Rynn's birthday rituals, had been more trick than treat and whose own insidious motives would soon lock them both in a perilous contest of will...<br /><br />Not the local policeman who came to call and, lured by what he had seen, returned...<br /><br />Not the shy young amateur magician who arrived on an errand-and stayed to become confidant and co-conspirator...<br /><br />Who was the little girl who lived in such strange seclusion at the end of the leaf-swept land? Lonely and innocent seeking shelter from a hostile world? Or consummate liar? Each for his own reason, the Hallets were determined to find out. And it was then that the terrible secrets of the house at the end of the lane emerged. <br /><br />Moving with swift and shocking turnabout to a profoundly disturbing denouement, here is a fine and freezing novel of suspense that probes the subtle bonds of innocence to evil."
Q1170697,The Pledge,Friedrich Dürrenmatt,2000,172,4493,130,3.98,"Set in a small town in Switzerland, The Pledge centers around the murder of a young girl and the detective who promises the victim's mother he will find the perpetrator. After deciding the wrong man has been arrested for the crime, the detective lays a trap for the real killer with all the patience of a master fisherman. But cruel turns of plot conspire to make him pay dearly for his pledge. Here Friedrich Dürrenmatt conveys his brilliant ear for dialogue and a devastating sense of timing and suspense. Joel Agee's skilled translation effectively captures the various voices in the original, as well as its chilling conclusion. One of Dürrenmatt's most diabolically imagined and constructed novels, The Pledge was adapted for the screen in 2000 in a film directed by Sean Penn and starring Jack Nicholson."

The speaker is David Kepesh, white-haired and over sixty, an eminent TV culture critic and star lecturer at a New York college - as well as an articulate propagandist of the sexual revolution. For years he has made a practice of sleeping with adventurous female students while maintaining an aesthete's critical distance. But now that distance has been annihilated.<br />The agency of Kepesh's undoing is Consuela Castillo, the decorous, humblingly beautiful twenty-four-year-old daughter of Cuban exiles. When he becomes involved with her, Kepesh finds himself dragged helplessly into the quagmire of sexual jealousy and loss. In chronicling the themes of eros and mortality, licence and repression, freedom and sacrifice. <i>The Dying Animal</i> is a burning coal of a book, filled with intellectual heat and not a little danger."

It is also the country which on December 31, 1999, will gain full control of the Panama Canal. <br />Seldom has the weight of politics descended so heavily on such a tiny and unprepared nation. And seldom has the hidden eye of the British Intelligence selected such an unlikely champion as Harry Pendel - a charmer, a dreamer, an evader, a fabulist and presiding genius to the house of Pendel &amp; Braithwaite Co. Limitada, Tailors to Royalty, formerly of London and presently of Panama City.<br />Yet there is a logic to the spies' choice, for everybody who is anybody in Cental America passes through Pendel's doors. He dresses politicos and crooks and conmen. His fitting room hears more confidences than the priest's confessional. And when Harry Pendel doesn't hear things as such - well, he hears them anyway, by other means.<br />In a thrilling, hilarious AudioBook, le Carre once again effortlessly expands the borders of the spy story to bring us a magnificent entertainment straight out of the pages of tomorrow's history."

Q1194499,Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal,Eric Schlosser,2001,376,195864,4941,3.74,"On any given day, one out of four Americans opts for a quick and cheap meal at a fast-food restaurant, without giving either its speed or its thriftiness a second thought. Fast food is so ubiquitous that it now seems as American, and harmless, as apple pie. But the industry's drive for consolidation, homogenization, and speed has radically transformed America's diet, landscape, economy, and workforce, often in insidiously destructive ways. Eric Schlosser, an award-winning journalist, opens his ambitious and ultimately devastating exposé with an introduction to the iconoclasts and high school dropouts, such as Harlan Sanders and the McDonald brothers, who first applied the principles of a factory assembly line to a commercial kitchen. Quickly, however, he moves behind the counter with the overworked and underpaid teenage workers, onto the factory farms where the potatoes and beef are grown, and into the slaughterhouses run by giant meatpacking corporations. Schlosser wants you to know why those French fries taste so good (with a visit to the world's largest flavor company) and ""what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns."" Eater beware: forget your concerns about cholesterol, there is--literally--feces in your meat. <p> Schlosser's investigation reaches its frightening peak in the meatpacking plants as he reveals the almost complete lack of federal oversight of a seemingly lawless industry. His searing portrayal of the industry is disturbingly similar to Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>, written in 1906: nightmare working conditions, union busting, and unsanitary practices that introduce <i>E. coli</i> and other pathogens into restaurants, public schools, and homes. Almost as disturbing is his description of how the industry ""both feeds and feeds off the young,"" insinuating itself into all aspects of children's lives, even the pages of their school books, while leaving them prone to obesity and disease. Fortunately, Schlosser offers some eminently practical remedies. ""Eating in the United States should no longer be a form of high-risk behavior,"" he writes. Where to begin? Ask yourself, is the true cost of having it ""your way"" really worth it? <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>"

Il suo viaggio sembra portare ai confini del mondo abitato, in una costruzione militaresca che appare ""antica e deserta"", in un luogo in cui ristagna un torpore misterioso e tutto, dalle mura al paesaggio, traspira un'aria inospitale e sinistra. Per trent'anni Giovanni Drogo subisce l'oscuro male dei fortini, delle ridotte, delle casematte, e quella sorta di stregata immobilità si insinua fra i personaggi, come per salvaguardare il presentimento di nobili imprese. Qui Drogo attende, come tutti gli altri, che qualcosa dal deserto si muova, ma questo accade quando la sua vita è giunta al vero confine dell'uomo ed egli muore solo, in una povera locanda sulla strada di ritorno verso casa. La storia acquista così una sua forza allegorica, che investe tutti gli uomini, il senso delle loro azioni e della loro esistenza."
Q1216839,The Dead,James Joyce,1993,156,15530,613,4.05,"Adopted at more than 1,000 colleges and universities, Bedford/St. Martin's innovative <i>Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism</i> series has introduced more than a quarter of a million students to literary theory and earned enthusiastic praise nationwide. Along with an authoritative text of a major literary work, each volume presents critical essays, selected or prepared especially for students, that approach the work from several contemporary critical perspectives, such as gender criticism and cultural studies. Each essay is accompanied by an introduction (with bibliography) to the history, principles, and practice of its critical perspective. Every volume also surveys the biographical, historical, and critical contexts of the literary work and concludes with a glossary of critical terms. New editions reprint cultural documents that contextualize the literary works and feature essays that show how critical perspectives can be combined."
Q1216940,The Day of the Triffids,John Wyndham,1975,199,87563,2098,4.02,"Bill Masen wakes in his hospital bed, eyes bandaged. Something is wrong: it’s unusually quiet and no one has come to his room. When he removes his bandages he finds a world that has changed utterly. Most of the population are completely blind – only those who didn’t watch the night sky can still see. And, as law and order break down, a new menace appears – Triffids, walking carnivorous plants that can kill a human with their lethal sting. For Bill and the other survivors, it’s now a battle to stay alive. Gary Watson stars as Bill, with Barbara Shelley as Josella in these six stirring episodes. Also amongst the cast are Peter Sallis, Marjorie Westbury and some names familiar to <i>Doctor Who</i> aficionados: Peter Pratt, Christopher Bidmead and David Brierley.

Q1217144,Marat/Sade,Peter Weiss,1969,141,4249,7,4.03,"Set in Charenton Asylum (the later Esquirol hospital), Die Verfolgung und Ermordung Jean Paul Marats dargestellt durch die Schauspielgruppe des Hospizes zu Charenton unter Anleitung des Herrn de Sade (The Persecution &amp; Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade) is a play within a play. The main story occurs on 7/13/1808. De Sade's play within the story occurs during the Revolution, culminating in Jean-Paul Marat's assassination on 7/13/1793, then goes up to 1808. The actors are inmates of the asylum. Nurses &amp; supervisors occasionally step in to restore order. The bourgeois director of the hospital, Coulmier, supervises the performance, accompanied by his wife &amp; daughter. He supports Napoleon'a post-revolutionary government in place at the time of the production &amp; believes the play will endorse his patriotic views. His patients have other ideas. They speak lines he tried to suppress or deviate entirely into personal opinion. Suffice it to say that they, having come out of the revolution no better than they went in, are not entirely pleased with the course of events.<br /> The Marquis de Sade did direct performances in Charenton with other inmates, encouraged by Coulmier. He is a main character, conducting many dialogs with Marat, observing the proceedings with sardonic amusement. He remains detached, caring little for practical politics &amp; the inmates' talk of right &amp; justice. He simply stands by as an observer &amp; an advocate of his own nihilistic, individualist beliefs. One powerful scene depicts him being whipped on his own instructions. Such bold scenes are not alone, nor confined to the Marquis' predilections."

Nowadays, when the catastrophe that it seemed to be and its causes are matters equally inconsequential, I am increasingly disposed to the belief that he brought himself to the point of deserting me because I made such outrageous scenes at first mention of the possibility."

Wells,1975,208,12694,393,3.68,"Herbert George Wells (1866-1946) was an English writer best known for such science fiction novels as The Time Machine (1888), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The War of the Worlds (1897), The Invisible Man: A Grotesque Romance (1897) and The First Men in the Moon (1900-01).

El acierto del escritor está en haber convertido en obra de arte extremadamente singular los materiales que maneja. Los personajes tienden al estereotipo de buenos y malos, pero lo superan hasta convertirse en seres humanos de una verdad y hondura absolutas. El escenario resulta inédito gracias a la plasticidad de las descripciones. Las anécdotas, en su deliberada insignificancia, aportan ese interés por conocer sucesos indeslgable de la mayor y mejor tradición del género novelesco. Y, en cuanto al compromiso del escritor con la justicia, no hay en la obra un solo gramo de propaganda, ni tampoco se proponen mesianismos redentores: la verdad desnuda y escueta de los personajes y de sus acciones produce un emocionado y contundente alegato contra los poderosos y a favor de los desheredados.</p><p>SANTOS SANZ VILLANUEVA</p>"

Staffed by idealistic aides chosen primarily for their views on issues such as abortion and capital punishment, the CPA spent the crucial first year of occupation pursuing goals that had little to do with the immediate needs of a postwar nation: flat taxes instead of electricity and deregulated health care instead of emergency medical supplies. In this acclaimed firsthand account, the former Baghdad bureau chief of <i>The Washington Post</i> gives us an intimate portrait of life inside this Oz-like bubble, which continued unaffected by the growing mayhem outside. This is a quietly devastating tale of imperial folly, and the definitive history of those early days when things went irrevocably wrong in Iraq."

Terrified, Henry deserts his comrades. Upon returning to his regiment, he struggles with his shame as he tries to redeem himself and prove his courage.<br /><br /><i>The Red Badge of Courage</i> is Stephen Crane’s second book, notable for its realism and the fact that Crane had never personally experienced battle. Crane drew heavy inspiration from <i>Century Magazine</i>, a periodical known for its articles about the American Civil War. However, he criticized the articles for their lack of emotional depth and decided to write a war novel of his own. The manuscript was first serialized in December 1894 by <i>The Philadelphia Press</i> and quickly won Crane international acclaim before he died in June 1900 at the age of 28."

Q12411733,A Woman in Jerusalem,A.B. Yehoshua,2006,246,1286,132,3.425,"A woman in her forties is a victim of a suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market. Her body lies nameless in a hospital morgue. She had apparently worked as a cleaning woman at a bakery, but there is no record of her employment. When a Jerusalem daily accuses the bakery of ""gross negligence and inhumanity toward an employee,"" the bakery’s owner, overwhelmed by guilt, entrusts the task of identifying and burying the victim to a human resources man. This man is at first reluctant to take on the job, but as the facts of the woman’s life take shape—she was an engineer from the former Soviet Union, a non-Jew on a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and, judging by an early photograph, beautiful—he yields to feelings of regret, atonement, and even love. At once profoundly serious and highly entertaining, A. B. Yehoshua astonishes us with his masterly, often unexpected turns in the story and with his ability to get under the skin and into the soul of Israel today."
Q1241741,Maurice,E.M. Forster,1971,256,27013,1043,4.03,"Publicada en 1971 tras la muerte de E. M. Forster, que no quiso darla a la imprenta en vida por temor al alboroto que podría suscitar, <i>Maurice</i> se convirtió rápidamente en obra emblemática de una experiencia vital común a millones de personas. En efecto, la novela, escrita con la sabiduría propia del autor de <i>Pasaje a la India</i>, narra el descubrimiento del amor homosexual de un joven de familia acomodada y su subsiguiente vivencia del mismo. El valor de la novela, sin embargo, no reside sólo en la exploración conmovedora y magistral de un tema tradicionalmente tabú, sino en la decidida y optimista voluntad de Forster de redimirlo de sombras, tormentos y desdichas: «El final feliz era imperativo. Estaba decidido a que por lo menos en una obra de ficción dos hombres se enamorasen y permaneciesen unidos en ese para siempre que la ficción permite; y en ese sentido, Maurice y Alec aún vagan por los bosques. La única penalidad que la sociedad les impone es un exilio que alegremente abrazan»."

Q1247044,Elmer Gantry,Sinclair Lewis,1967,432,4822,321,3.99,"Today universally recognized as a landmark in American literature, <i>Elmer Gantry</i> scandalized readers when it was first published, causing Sinclair Lewis to be ""invited"" to a jail cell in New Hampshire and to his own lynching in Virginia. His portrait of a golden-tongued evangelist who rises to power within his church - a saver of souls who lives a life of hypocrisy, sensuality, and ruthless self-indulgence - is also the record of a period, a reign of grotesque vulgarity, which but for Lewis would have left no record of itself. <i>Elmer Gantry</i> has been called the greatest, most vital, and most penetrating study of hypocrisy that has been written since Voltaire."
Q1247253,Endless Night,Agatha Christie,1979,242,21349,30,3.78,"Gipsy’s Acre was a truly beautiful upland site with views out to sea – and in Michael Rogers it stirred a child-like fantasy. There, amongst the dark fir trees, he planned to build a house, find a girl and live happily ever after. Yet, as he left the village, a shadow of menace hung over the land. For this was the place where accidents happened. Perhaps Michael should have heeded the locals’ warnings: ‘There’s no luck for them as meddles with Gipsy’s Acre.’ Michael Rogers is a man who is about to learn the true meaning of the old saying ‘In my end is my beginning.’<br /><br />The title Endless Night was taken from William Blake’s Auguries of Innocence and describes Christie’s favourite theme in the novel: a “twisted” character, who always chooses evil over good.<br /><br />Christie finished Endless Night in six weeks, as opposed to the three-four months that most of her other novels took. Despite being in her seventies while writing it, she told an interviewer that being Michael, the twenty-something narrator, “wasn’t difficult. After all, you hear people like him talking all the time.”<br /><br />The book is dedicated to Christie's relative ""Nora Prichard from whom I first heard the legend of Gipsy's Acre."" Gipsy's Acre was a field on the Welsh moors."

Q1248928,The Admirable Crichton,J.M. Barrie,1918,137,458,37,3.72,"A comedy play. A moment before the curtain rises, the Hon. Ernest Woolley drives up to the door of Loam House in Mayfair. There is a happy smile on his pleasant, insignificant face, and this presumably means that he is thinking of himself. He is too busy over nothing, this man about town, to be always thinking of himself, but, on the other hand, he almost never thinks of any other person. Probably Ernest's great moment is when he wakes of a morning and realises that he really is Ernest, for we must all wish to be that which is our ideal. We can conceive him springing out of bed light-heartedly and waiting for his man to do the rest. He is dressed in excellent taste, with just the little bit more which shows that he is not without a sense of humour: the dandiacal are often saved by carrying a smile at the whole thing in their spats, let us say. Ernest left Cambridge the other day, a member of The Athenaeum (which he would be sorry to have you confound with a club in London of the same name). He is a bachelor, but not of arts, no mean epigrammatist (as you shall see), and a favourite of the ladies. He is almost a celebrity in restaurants, where he dines frequently, returning to sup; and during this last year he has probably paid as much in them for the privilege of handing his hat to an attendant as the rent of a working-man's flat. He complains brightly that he is hard up, and that if somebody or other at Westminster does not look out the country will go to the dogs. He is no fool. He has the shrewdness to float with the current because it is a labour-saving process, but he has sufficient pluck to fight, if fight he must (a brief contest, for he would soon be toppled over). He has a light nature, which would enable him to bob up cheerily in new conditions and return unaltered to the old ones."

Her putative African lover and traveling companion, a doctor with one of the aid agencies, has vanished from the scene of the crime. Tessa's much older husband, Justin, a career diplomat at the British High Commission in Nairobi, sets out on a personal odyssey in pursuit of the killers and their motive. <br /> A master chronicler of the deceptions and betrayals of ordinary people caught in political conflict, le Carré portrays, in <i>The Constant Gardener,</i> the dark side of unbridled capitalism. His eighteenth novel is also the profoundly moving story of a man whom tragedy elevates. Justin Quayle, amateur gardener and ineffectual bureaucrat, seemingly oblivious to his wife's cause, discovers his own resources and the extraordinary courage of the woman he barely had time to love. <br /> <i>The Constant Gardener</i> is a magnificent exploration of the new world order by one of the most compelling and elegant storytellers of our time."

Q127149,Lolita,Vladimir Nabokov,1961,304,653851,241,3.89,"<b>Vladimir Nabokov: Sex, Lies, and Premium Cable</b><p><br />By now, you undoubtedly know that Adrian Lyne's film version of Vladimir Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i> received its much belated American debut on August 2nd, on Showtime, and will be released in theaters next month. You very likely also know that the movie was, well, not <i>exactly</i> banned, but effectively so, by the refusal of American film distributors to participate in its release. And you probably have a sense of what the fuss was all about: The film is reportedly too racy for American eyes. But there's a very different angle on this story to be found through a closer look at the novel.<br /></p><p><br />Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i> was originally published in 1955 and immediately became embroiled in its own censorship battles. The story is admittedly, purposefully, a shocking one: Humbert Humbert, an emigré academic, has a thing for young girls. Nymphets, he calls them, prepubescent girls who betray some precocious awareness of their own sensuality. Upon accepting a position at a new college, Humbert rents a room in town and falls madly, passionately, horrifyingly in love with his landlady's 12-year-old daughter, Dolores Haze, the Lolita of the novel's title. He marries Dolores's mother in order to maintain proximity to Dolores herself, and his relationship with her very quickly exceeds the bounds of stepfatherly affection. <br /></p><p><br />There are several upsetting things about this story, not the least of which is that, it appears, Lolita herself is the seducer, and Humbert the seducee. Hence the ubiquitous comparisons of any precociously sexual, slightly dangerous girl to this character (for example, the ""Long Island Lolita""). These comparisons -- and the moral censorship to which the novel has been subject -- are, however, based on a most superficial reading of the book, one that overlooks a basic literary concept: the unreliable narrator.<br /></p><p><br />Humbert Humbert is the one who tells us the story. From an insane asylum. He's a child molester and, ultimately, a murderer. Why on earth should we take his word for how it happened?<br /></p><p><br />This, in fact, is the real story of <i>Lolita</i>. The novel is about the ways in which a reader can be manipulated to feel sympathy for -- even to identify with -- the most horrifying person imaginable. That early readers of the novel were so shocked by Dolores's behavior -- so shocked, in fact, that governments moved to ban the book -- is precisely Nabokov's point: Rather than acknowledge the ultimate evil that lies under the otherwise charming persona, we as a culture are more inclined to turn him into a tragic hero, a victim.<br /></p><p><br /><i>Lolita</i> was, of course, filmed years ago by Stanley Kubrick. Nabokov wrote a screenplay for the movie that was ultimately cast aside. The Kubrick film is quirky, almost to a fault; Nabokov himself reportedly said that he liked the movie quite a lot, though it had nothing whatsoever to do with his novel. Kubrick managed to evade at least some of the moral terror surrounding his subject by casting Sue Lyons as Dolores. Lyons was 16 when the film was shot, a slightly too young woman rather than a child. <br /></p><p><br />Adrian Lyne has left himself no such comfort zone. While in London earlier this summer, I happily got a chance to see the new film and form my own opinions, the first of which is this: Dominique Swain is stunning as Dolores, one moment a seductress and the very next a gawky child. And Jeremy Irons's Humbert is passionate and terrifying. The film is lushly, beautifully shot -- uncomfortably so, at moments -- and quite faithful to the novel. At least to what the novel claims to say, what Humbert says it says. But the film misses, unfortunately, exactly what the critics all along have missed: Humbert Humbert is not to be trusted. This is, I suspect, one of the fundamental differences in narrative possibility between the novel and film, one that makes any complete adaptation of <i>Lolita</i> all but impossible: Film really has no equivalent to the unreliable narrator. Some films do experiment with multiple perspectives -- see, for instance, Kurosawa's <i>Rashomon</i> -- and so manage to cast doubt on any sense of truth. More recently, <i>The Opposite of Sex</i> presents a thoroughly untrustworthy narrator, but one who happily tells the audience when she's lying. But the puzzle presented by a narrator as charming and horrible as Humbert Humbert is perhaps one that can only be appreciated through the novel.<br /></p><p><br />Nabokov plays repeatedly throughout his novels with such narrative puzzles. <i>Pale Fire</i>, for instance, presents itself as the definitive annotated edition of the last poem of the late John Shade, with commentary by his faithful friend, Charles Kinbote. But the commentary has far more to do with Kinbote than it does with Shade's poem, and ultimately reveals that Kinbote may not be at all who he claims to be, and may in fact not be the identity he's hiding, either. <i>Pnin</i> is the third-person story of a befuddled Russian academic whose perceptions of reality seem more than a little skewed. <i>Ada, or Ardor</i> is the ultimate family romance, a philosophical treatise posing as a novel, annotated by Vivian Darkbloom (an anagram of Vladimir Nabokov and a character who receives brief mention in <i>Lolita</i>). And <i>Despair</i> is literally, as all of Nabokov's novels are figuratively, a mystery.<br /></p><p><br />These mysteries are the heart of Nabokov's writing, and though LOLITA appears a straightforward story, the reader should always be wary. My recommendations about <i>Lolita</i>: See the film. It's beautiful, it's compelling, and it's important. But more to the point: Read the novel. If you've never read it, I envy you the joys of your first encounter with it. If you've read it before, read it again; it offers up something new each time. As do all of Nabokov's intricate puzzles: Each text begs you to take it apart, look at it from the other side, figure out where the truth might actually lie.<br /></p><p>Kathleen Fitzpatrick</p>"

But he suddenly discovers that he can inherit seven times as much from his eccentric uncle if he spends every cent of his grandfather's money within a year. The carefree prospect of running through a fortune in order to receive an even greater windfall turns into a comic burden because of his uncle's stipulations: Monty must spend responsibly, showing good business sense, limiting his charitable contributions, and maintaining utter secrecy about the second inheritance.<br />Can Monty run through the million according to his uncle's terms? His friends are aghast at his madcap extravagance — the gambling, the risky investments, the lavish parties — and Monty's romance with a banker's daughter is imperiled by his seemingly reckless spending. This sprightly comedy, originally published in 1902, offers an atmospheric picture of New York City at the turn of the twentieth century and its intriguing premise has served as the source of ten movie adaptations."

Eight sets his sights not on proving the other jurors wrong but rather on getting them to look at the situation in a clear-eyed way not affected by their personal prejudices or biases.

Q1422745,The Witches,Roald Dahl,1983,208,305420,148,4.18,"""This is not a fairy tale. This is about real witches."" So begins one of Roald Dahl's best books ever, and, ironically, it is such a great story because the premise is perfectly plausible from the outset. When the narrator's parents die in a car crash on page two (contrast this terribly real demise with that of James's parents who are devoured by an escaped rhinoceros in James and the Giant Peach), he is taken in by his cigar-smoking Norwegian grandmother, who has learned a storyteller's respect for witches and is wise to their ways.<p> The bond between the boy and his grandmother becomes the centrepiece of the tale--a partnership of love and understanding that survives even the boy's unfortunate transformation into a mouse. And once the two have teamed up to outwitch the witches, the boy's declaration that he's glad he's a mouse because he will now live only as long as his grandmother is far more poignant than eerie.</p><p> Of course, there's adventure here along with Dahl's trademark cleverness and sense of the grotesque. Dahl also communicates some essential truths to children: if they smoke cigars, they'll never catch cold, and, most importantly, they should never bathe, because a clean child is far, far easier for a witch to smell than a dirty one.

A professional ghostwriter is sent out to rescue the project - a man more used to working with fading rock stars and minor celebrities than ex-world leaders.

Q1424555,Chocolat,Joanne Harris,1999,306,109893,3017,3.96,"When the exotic stranger Vianne Rocher arrives in the old French village of Lansquenet and opens a chocolate boutique called “La Celeste Praline” directly across the square from the church, Father Reynaud identifies her as a serious danger to his flock. It is the beginning of Lent: the traditional season of self-denial. The priest says she’ll be out of business by Easter.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Vianne does not go to church and has a penchant for superstition. Like her mother, she can read Tarot cards. But she begins to win over customers with her smiles, her intuition for everyone’s favourites, and her delightful confections. Her shop provides a place, too, for secrets to be whispered, grievances aired. She begins to shake up the rigid morality of the community. Vianne’s plans for an Easter Chocolate Festival divide the whole community. Can the solemnity of the Church compare with the pagan passion of a chocolate éclair?<br /><br />For the first time, here is a novel in which chocolate enjoys its true importance, emerging as an agent of transformation. Rich, clever, and mischievous, reminiscent of a folk tale or fable, this is a triumphant read with a memorable character at its heart.<br /><br />Says Harris: “You might see [Vianne] as an archetype or a mythical figure. I prefer to see her as the lone gunslinger who blows into the town, has a showdown with the man in the black hat, then moves on relentless. But on another level she is a perfectly real person with real insecurities and a very human desire for love and acceptance. Her qualities too - kindness, love, tolerance - are very human.” Vianne and her young daughter Anouk, come into town on Shrove Tuesday. “Carnivals make us uneasy,” says Harris, “because of what they represent: the residual memory of blood sacrifice (it is after all from the word ""carne"" that the term arises), of pagan celebration. And they represent a loss of inhibition; carnival time is a time at which almost anything is possible.”<br /><br />The book became an international best-seller, and was optioned to film quickly. The Oscar-nominated movie, with its star-studded cast including Juliette Binoche (<i>The English Patient</i>) and Judi Dench (<i>Shakespeare in Love</i>), was directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose previous film <i>The Cider House Rules</i> (based on a John Irving novel) also looks at issues of community and moral standards, though in a less lighthearted vein.<br /><br />The idea for the book came from a comment her husband made one day while he was immersed in a football game on TV. “It was a throwaway comment, designed to annoy and it did. It was along the lines of...<i>Chocolate is to women what football is to men…</i>” The idea stuck, and Harris began thinking that “people have these conflicting feelings about chocolate, and that a lot of people who have very little else in common relate to chocolate in more or less the same kind of way. It became a kind of challenge to see exactly how much of a story I could get which was uniquely centred around chocolate.” <br /><br />Rich with metaphor and gorgeous writing...sit back and gorge yourself on <b>Chocolat</b>."

During the reign of Catherine the Great, the young Grinev sets out for his new career in the army and en route performs an act of kindness by giving his warm coat to a man freezing in a blizzard. This action reaps its reward when he subsequently finds himself caught up in the rebellion headed by the infamous, and strangely familiar, Pugachev. Rivalry with a fellow officer for the affections of Captain Mironov's daughter further complicates Grinev's affairs, and ultimately it is only an appeal by Masha Mironova, the eponymous captain's daughter, to the Empress herself that can unravel a tangled web."

Q147787,Anna Karenina,Leo Tolstoy,1967,873,660721,1873,4.05,"Acclaimed by many as the world's greatest novel, <i>Anna Karenina</i> provides a vast panorama of contemporary life in Russia and of humanity in general. In it Tolstoy uses his intense imaginative insight to create some of the most memorable characters in literature. Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.<br /><br />Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch.

This suspenseful tale begins in a detective's office in Venice, as the entirely unpleasant Hartliebs request Victor Getz's services to search for two boys, Prosper and Bo, the sons of Esther Hartlieb's recently deceased sister. Twelve-year-old Prosper and 5-year-old Bo ran away when their aunt decided she wanted to adopt Bo, but not his brother. Refusing to split up, they escaped to Venice, a city their mother had always described reverently, in great detail. Right away they hook up with a long-haired runaway named Hornet and various other ruffians who hole up in an abandoned movie theater and worship the elusive Thief Lord, a young boy named Scipio who steals jewels from fancy Venetian homes so his new friends can get the warm clothes they need. Of course, the plot thickens when the owner of the pawn shop asks if the Thief Lord will carry out a special mission for a wealthy client: to steal a broken wooden wing that is the key to completing an age-old, magical merry-go-round. This winning cast of characters--especially the softhearted detective with his two pet turtles--will win the hearts of readers young and old, and the adventures are as labyrinthine and magical as the streets of Venice itself.

Q165318,Crime and Punishment,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,1914,540,628078,253,4.22,"The talented Alex Jennings creates an atmosphere of gripping psychological tension and brings a variety of characters to life in this new audio edition of a crime classic.

However, Dostoyevsky's rendering of 18th-century Russia emerges unscathed, bringing the dark pathos (such as wretched poverty and rampant suffering) to life.

Q1660401,Tales of Moonlight and Rain,Ueda Akinari,1972,235,1635,67,3.87,"First published in 1776, the nine gothic tales in this collection are Japan's finest and most celebrated examples of the literature of the occult. They subtly merge the world of reason with the realm of the uncanny and exemplify the period's fascination with the strange and the grotesque. They were also the inspiration for Mizoguchi Kenji's brilliant 1953 film <i>Ugetsu</i>.<br /><br />The title <i>Ugetsu monogatari</i> (literally ""rain-moon tales"") alludes to the belief that mysterious beings appear on cloudy, rainy nights and in mornings with a lingering moon. In ""Shiramine,"" the vengeful ghost of the former emperor Sutoku reassumes the role of king; in ""The Chrysanthemum Vow,"" a faithful revenant fulfills a promise; ""The Kibitsu Cauldron"" tells a tale of spirit possession; and in ""The Carp of My Dreams,"" a man straddles the boundaries between human and animal and between the waking world and the world of dreams. The remaining stories feature demons, fiends, goblins, strange dreams, and other manifestations beyond all logic and common sense.<br /><br />The eerie beauty of this masterpiece owes to Akinari's masterful combination of words and phrases from Japanese classics with creatures from Chinese and Japanese fiction and lore. Along with <i>The Tale of Genji</i> and <i>The Tales of the Heike</i>, <i>Tales of Moonlight and Rain</i> has become a timeless work of great significance. This new translation, by a noted translator and scholar, skillfully maintains the allure and complexity of Akinari's original prose."

Rich with the uncanny sense of life and action characteristic of his writing — from his earliest stories <i>(In Our Time)</i> to his last novella <i>(The Old Man and the Sea)</i> — this compelling novel contains both the warmth of recollection that inspired <i>A Moveable Feast</i> and a rare glimpse of Hemingway's rich and relaxed sense of humor, which enlivens scene after scene. <br /> Beginning in the 1930s, <i>Islands in the Stream</i> follows the fortunes of Thomas Hudson from his experiences as a painter on the Gulf Stream island of Bimini, where his loneliness is broken by the vacation visit of his three young sons, to his antisubmarine activities off the coast of Cuba during World War II. The greater part of the story takes place in a Havana bar, where a wildly diverse cast of characters — including an aging prostitute who stands out as one of Hemingway's most vivid creations — engages in incomparably rich dialogue. A brilliant portrait of the inner life of a complex and endlessly intriguing man, <i>Islands in the Stream</i> is Hemingway at his mature best."

At first she gains strength by fighting back, taking a civilian job with the police to aid the antiterrorist effort. But when she becomes involved with an upper-class couple, she is drawn into a psychological maelstrom of guilt, ambition, and cynicism that erodes her faith in the society she’s working to defend. And when a new bomb threat sends the city into a deadly panic (“It was a panic like the darkest dream and the more people ran out onto the streets the bigger the panic got like a monster made of human beings”) she is pushed to acts of unfathomable desperation—perhaps her only chance for survival.<br /><br />A surreal vision made brilliantly, viscerally powerful and undeniable, <i>Incendiary</i> is a stunning debut novel.<br /><br /><i>The author responded to the tragic events which took place in London on July 7, 2005.

They enjoy a comfortable life with their parents Tom and Helen Lawrence.

When Tom and Helen receive a letter from Harry, in which he announces he will travel to them for a vacation, they see an opportunity to get a break from the kids. Knowing that Harry is an expert on children, they assume that he will appreciate the gesture and leave just after he arrives. Unbeknownst to them, Harry only wrote a book about raising children because his publisher told him to, and actually he isn't fond of children at all. He reluctantly takes the position as the babysitter of his nieces and is escorted by Alice Mayton, the Lawrence's attractive neighbor.<br /><i>From the Wikipedia summary of the plot of the film.</i><br /><br />The book is cited in George Orwell's 1945 essay ""Good Bad Books"" as an example of ""the kind of book that has no literary pretensions but which remains readable when more serious productions have perished."""
Q170583,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,1973,350,3017177,42165,4.26,"<i>""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.""</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, ""Call me Ishmael,"" the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: ""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."" She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print"". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"

A leading figure in Kenya's colonial community, he had recently been appointed Military Secretary, but he was primarily a seducer of other men's wives. Sir Henry Delves Broughton, whose wife was Erroll's current conquest, had an obvious motive for the murder, but no one was ever convicted and the question of who killed him became a classic mystery, a scandel and cause celebre. Among those who became fascinated with the Erroll case was Cyril Connolly. He joined up with James Fox for a major investigation of the case in 1969 for the SUNDAY TIMES magazine. After his death James Fox inherited the obsession and a commitment to continue in pursuit of the story both in England and Kenya in the late 1970s. One day, on a veranda overlooking the Indian Ocean, Fox came across a piece of evidence that seemed to bring all the fragments and pieces together and convinced him that he saw a complete picture."

Q1758947,Anna Christie,Eugene O'Neill,2000,49,852,51,3.5,"Early in his career, Eugene O'Neill (1888–1953) wrote a series of plays revolving around characters obsessed with the sea. This period culminated in the 1922 production of <i>Anna Christie, </i>a Pulitzer Prize–winning drama of social realism that was among the first of the author's plays to explore characters searching for their own identities. Centering on the reunion of a barge captain and his daughter after a twenty-year separation, the play derives its tension from the former's disaffection for the seafaring life and the latter's love for a sailor. The father-daughter conflict elicits a shocking confession, which illuminates the author's contention that character is fate and the seemingly external forces controlling destiny actually lie within.<br /><i>Anna Christie </i>amply displays O'Neill's extraordinary insights into character and his masterly use of language, qualities that have earned him acclaim as one of America's greatest playwrights. Students and lovers of modern theater will prize this inexpensive edition of his landmark drama."

Q1767259,Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda,Roméo Dallaire,2003,584,10559,531,4.24,"On the 10th anniversary of when UN peacekeepers landed in Rwanda, Random House Canada proudly publishes the unforgettable 1st-hand account of the genocide by the leader of the mission. Digging deep into shattering memories, Dallaire has written a powerful story of betrayal, naïveté, racism &amp; international politics. His message is simple, undeniable: Never again. When Lt-Gen. Roméo Dallaire was called to serve as force commander of the UN intervention in Rwanda in '93, he thought he was heading off on a straightforward peacekeeping mission. Thirteen months later he flew home from Africa, broken, disillusioned &amp; suicidal, having witnessed the slaughter of 800,000 Rwandans in 100 days. In Shake Hands with the Devil, he takes readers with him on a return voyage into hell, vividly recreating the events the international community turned its back on. This book is an unsparing eyewitness account of the failure by humanity to stop the genocide, despite timely warnings. Woven thru the story of this disastrous mission is his own journey from confident Cold Warrior, to devastated UN commander, to retired general engaged in a painful struggle to find a measure of peace, hope &amp; reconciliation. This book is a personal account of his conversion from a man certain of his worth &amp; secure in his assumptions to one conscious of his own weaknesses &amp; failures &amp; critical of the institutions he'd relied on. It might not sit easily with standard ideas of military leadership, but understanding what happened to him &amp; his mission to Rwanda is crucial to understanding the moral minefields peacekeepers are forced to negotiate when we ask them to step into dirty wars.<br /> Excerpt: My story is not a strictly military account nor a clinical, academic study of the breakdown of Rwanda. It is not a simplistic indictment of the many failures of the UN as a force for peace in the world. It is not a story of heroes &amp; villains, altho such a work could easily be written. This book is a cri de coeur for the slaughtered thousands, a tribute to the souls hacked apart by machetes because of their supposed difference from those who sought to hang on to power...This book is the account of a few humans who were entrusted with the role of helping others taste the fruits of peace. Instead, we watched as the devil took control of paradise on earth &amp; fed on the blood of the people we were supposed to protect."

Q183565,Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,Jules Verne,1969,319,197172,3144,3.89,"When an unidentified “monster” threatens international shipping, French oceanographer Pierre Aronnax and his unflappable assistant Conseil join an expedition organized by the US Navy to hunt down and destroy the menace. After months of fruitless searching, they finally grapple with their quarry, but Aronnax, Conseil, and the brash Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard in the attack, only to find that the “monster” is actually a futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by a shadowy, mystical, preternaturally imposing man who calls himself Captain Nemo. Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis. Jules Verne’s novel of undersea exploration has been captivating readers ever since its first publication in 1870, and Frederick Paul Walter’s reader-friendly, scientifically meticulous translation of this visionary science fiction classic is complete and unabridged down to the smallest substantive detail."
Q1836777,Lucky Jim,Kingsley Amis,1958,256,24804,1287,3.78,"Regarded by many as the finest, and funniest, comic novel of the twentieth century, <i>Lucky Jim</i> remains as trenchant, withering, and eloquently misanthropic as when it first scandalized readers in 1954. This is the story of Jim Dixon, a hapless lecturer in medieval history at a provincial university who knows better than most that “there was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.” Kingsley Amis’s scabrous debut leads the reader through a gallery of emphatically English bores, cranks, frauds, and neurotics with whom Dixon must contend in one way or another in order to hold on to his cushy academic perch and win the girl of his fancy.<br /><br />More than just a merciless satire of cloistered college life and stuffy postwar manners, <i>Lucky Jim</i> is an attack on the forces of boredom, whatever form they may take, and a work of art that at once distills and extends an entire tradition of English comic writing, from Fielding and Dickens through Wodehouse and Waugh. As Christopher Hitchens has written, “If you can picture Bertie or Jeeves being capable of actual malice, and simultaneously imagine Evelyn Waugh forgetting about original sin, you have the combination of innocence and experience that makes this short romp so imperishable.”"

Q191663,The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,1969,509,189485,2382,3.5,"<p>The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i><br /><br />If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.</p>"

Q192649,The Red and the Black,Stendhal,1972,560,56733,35,3.88,"Au rouge des armes, Julien Sorel préfèrera le noir des ordres. Au cours de son ascension sociale, deux femmes se singularisent, comme pour figurer les deux penchants de son caractère : Madame de Rênal - le rêve, l'aspiration à un bonheur pur et simple - et Mathilde de La Mole - l'énergie, l'action brillante et fébrile. A ces composantes stendhaliennes (conception de la vie qui dépasse la stratégie narrative pour s'étendre à l'existence de l'auteur) correspondent deux facettes stylistiques : la sobriété et la restriction du champ de vision. Dans cette <i>Chronique de 1830</i>, bien avant l'existence du cinéma donc, Stendhal alterne les prises de vue pour concilier réalisme et romantisme. <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i>, portrait social, est également un roman de l'individualité où le regard des personnages sert de philtre au narrateur et où la cristallisation stendhalienne, cette phase irisée <i>De l'amour</i>, trouve un formidable support dans les champs, contrechamps, plongées et contre-plongées. Cette écriture visuelle ajoute à l'analyse une intelligence psychologique profonde.

Q193417,Madame Bovary,Gustave Flaubert,1964,393,250156,392,3.68,"<i>'Oh, why, dear God, did I marry him?'</i><br /><br />Emma Bovary is beautiful and bored, trapped in her marriage to a mediocre doctor and stifled by the banality of provincial life. An ardent devourer of sentimental novels, she longs for passion and seeks escape in fantasies of high romance, in voracious spending and, eventually, in adultery. But even her affairs bring her disappointment, and when real life continues to fail to live up to her romantic expectations, the consequences are devastating. Flaubert's erotically charged and psychologically acute portrayal of Emma Bovary caused a moral outcry on its publication in 1857. It was deemed so lifelike that many women claimed they were the model for his heroine; but Flaubert insisted: 'Madame Bovary, c'est moi.'<br /><br />This modern translation by Flaubert's biographer, Geoffrey Wall, retains all the delicacy and precision of the French original.

Q1965615,La Confession d'un enfant du siècle,Alfred de Musset,1999,295,1247,18,3.71,"Alfred Louis Charles de Musset-Pathay (1810-1857) was a French dramatist, poet, and novelist. After attempts at careers in medicine, law, drawing, English and piano, he became one of the first Romantic writers, with his first collection of poems, Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie (Tales of Spain and Italy) (1829). He was the librarian of the French Ministry of the Interior under the July Monarchy. The tale of his celebrated love affair with George Sand, which lasted from 1833 to 1835, is told from his point of view in his autobiographical novel, La Confession d'un Enfant du Siècle (The Confession of a Child of the Century) made into a film, Children of the Century.

Among them is Rafael Sánchez Mazas-writer, fascist, and founder of the Spanish Falange. As the machine guns begin to fire, Sánchez Mazas escapes into the forest. When a militiaman discovers his hiding place, Sánchez Mazas faces death for the second time that day. But the unknown soldier simply turns and walks away.

Who was he? Why did he spare Sánchez Mazas? Every answer Cercas uncovers leads to another question in this powerful and elegantly constructed novel about truth, memory, and war."

Now, in this astounding and hilarious tell-all autobiography, Belfort narrates a story of greed, power, and excess no one could invent.<br /><br />Reputedly the prototype for the film Boiler Room, Stratton Oakmont turned microcap investing into a wickedly lucrative game as Belfort’s hyped-up, coked-out brokers browbeat clients into stock buys that were guaranteed to earn obscene profits–for the house. But an insatiable appetite for debauchery, questionable tactics, and a fateful partnership with a breakout shoe designer named Steve Madden would land Belfort on both sides of the law and into a harrowing darkness all his own. <br /><br />From the stormy relationship Belfort shared with his model-wife as they ran a madcap household that included two young children, a full-time staff of twenty-two, a pair of bodyguards, and hidden cameras everywhere—even as the SEC and FBI zeroed in on them—to the unbridled hedonism of his office life, here is the extraordinary story of an ordinary guy who went from hustling Italian ices at sixteen to making hundreds of millions.

Q1992099,Breakfast on Pluto,Patrick McCabe,1999,224,1945,100,3.49,"<p> <i>Breakfast on Pluto</i> became a #1 bestseller in Ireland, stayed on the bestseller list for months, and was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, one of the world's most prestigious literary awards. With wonderful delicacy and subtle insight and intimation, McCabe creates Mr. Patrick ""Pussy"" Braden, the enduringly and endearingly hopeful hero(ine) whose gutsy survival and yearning quest for love resonate in and drive the glimmering, agonizing narrative in which the troubles are a distant and immediate echo and refrain. Twenty years ago, her ladyship escaped her hometown of Tyreelin, Ireland, fleeing her foster mother Whiskers (prodigious Guinness-guzzler, human chimney) and her mad household, to begin a new life in London. There, in blousey tops and satin miniskirts, she plies her trade, often risking life and limb amongst the flotsam and jetsam that fill the bars of Piccadilly Circus. But suave businessmen and lonely old women are not the only dangers that threaten Pussy. It is the 1970's and fear haunts the streets of London and Belfast as the critical mass of history builds up, and Pussy is inevitably drawn into a maelstrom of violence and tragedy destined to blow his fragile soul asunder. Brilliant, startling, profound and soaring, <i>Breakfast on Pluto</i> combines light and dark, laughter and pain, with such sensitivity, directness and restraint that the dramatic impact reverberates in our minds and hearts long after the initial impression.</p>"

From sending the latest, not-yet-in-stores Harry Potter to Miranda’s children in Paris by private jet, to locating an unnamed antique store where Miranda had at some point admired a vintage dresser, to serving lattes to Miranda at precisely the piping hot temperature she prefers, Andrea is sorely tested each and every day—and often late into the night with orders barked over the phone.

A correspondent for the <i>Toronto Star,</i> Hemingway arrived in Paris in 1921, three years after the trauma of the Great War and at the beginning of the transformation of Europe's cultural landscape: Braque and Picasso were experimenting with cubist form; James Joyce, long living in self-imposed exile from his native Dublin, had just completed <i>Ulysses;</i> Gertrude Stein held court at 27 Rue de Fleurus, and deemed young Ernest a member of <i>une gneration perdue;</i> and T.S. Eliot was a bank clerk in London. It was during these years that the as-of-yet unpublished young writer gathered the material for his first novel <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> and the subsequent masterpieces that followed.<br /><p>Among these small, reflective sketches are unforgettable encounters with the members of Hemingway's slightly rag-tag circle of artists and writers, some also fated to achieve fame and glory, others to fall into obscurity. Here, too, is an evocation of the Paris that Hemingway knew as a young man - a map drawn in his distinct prose of the streets and cafes and bookshops that comprised the city in which he, as a young writer, sometimes struggling against the cold and hunger of near poverty, honed the skills of his craft.<br /></p><p><i>A Moveable Feast</i> is at once an elegy to the remarkable group for expatriates that gathered in Paris during the twenties and a testament to the risks and rewards of the writerly life.</p>"

Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him. The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted imply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.

As the still, radiant center of a plot whose turbulent action is extraordinary even for Dostoyevsky, Myshkin succeeds in dominating through sheer force of personality a cast of characters who vividly and violently embody the passions and conflicts of 19th-century Russia. The author's concern with sin and redemption is here in full measure; but there is another, more powerful motive as well: a desire to offer man a new alternative in facing the painful dilemmas of the human condition.

Q2124771,The Luck of Barry Lyndon,William Makepeace Thackeray,1970,326,1895,0,3.65,"The Luck of Barry Lyndon, serialized in Fraser's Magazine in 1844, is a wonderfully hard-edged advance upon Thackeray's previous writing: a tour de force dramatization at novelistic length of the moral vacuity of its first person narrator. The inner workings of this narrator are far more complicated than in earlier Thackeray writings, and are presented in a far more subtle, yet not humorless, manner. The mock-Bildungsroman aspect of the novel is brought about by the non-enlightenment of the title-figure, his failure to find a meaningful love-relationship, and his inability to discover a calling that identifies both a significant direction for his individual existence and, at the same time, an appropriate accommodation to his duties to society. Achieved in brilliant, accomplished style, Barry Lyndon is a significant and progressive experiment in narration for Thackeray."

Q21519570,Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation,John Carlin,2008,274,4182,316,4.15,"<b>A thrilling, inspiring account of one of the greatest charm offensives in history--Nelson Mandela's decade-long campaign to unite his country, beginning in his jail cell and ending with a rugby tournament.</b><br /><br />In 1985, Nelson Mandela, then in prison for twenty-three years, set about winning over the fiercest proponents of apartheid, from his jailers to the head of South Africa's military. First he earned his freedom and then he won the presidency in the nation's first free election in 1994. But he knew that South Africa was still dangerously divided by almost fifty years of apartheid. If he couldn't unite his country in a visceral, emotional way--and fast--it would collapse into chaos. He would need all the charisma and strategic acumen he had honed during half a century of activism, and he'd need a cause all South Africans could share. Mandela picked one of the more farfetched causes imaginable--the national rugby team, the Springboks, who would host the sport's World Cup in 1995.<br /><br />Against the giants of the sport, the Springboks' chances of victory were remote. But their chances of capturing the hearts of most South Africans seemed remoter still, as they had long been the embodiment of white supremacist rule. During apartheid, the all-white Springboks and their fans had belted out racist fight songs, and blacks would come to Springbok matches to cheer for whatever team was playing against them. Yet Mandela believed that the Springboks could embody--and engage--the new South Africa. And the Springboks themselves embraced the scheme. Soon South African TV would carry images of the team singing ""Nkosi Sikelele Afrika,"" the longtime anthem of black resistance to apartheid.<br /><br />As their surprising string of victories lengthened, their home-field advantage grew exponentially. South Africans of every color and political stripe found themselves falling for the team. When the Springboks took to the field for the championship match against New Zealand's heavily favored squad, Mandela sat in his presidential box wearing a Springbok jersey while sixty-two-thousand fans, mostly white, chanted ""Nelson! Nelson!"" Millions more gathered around their TV sets, whether in dusty black townships or leafy white suburbs, to urge their team toward victory. The Springboks won a nail-biter that day, defying the oddsmakers and capping Mandela's miraculous ten-year-long effort to bring forty-three million South Africans together in an enduring bond.<br /><br />John Carlin, a former South Africa bureau chief for the London <i>Independent</i>, offers a singular portrait of the greatest statesman of our time in action, blending the volatile cocktail of race, sport, and politics to intoxicating effect. He draws on extensive interviews with Mandela, Desmond Tutu, and dozens of other South Africans caught up in Mandela's momentous campaign, and the Springboks' unlikely triumph. As he makes stirringly clear, their championship transcended the mere thrill of victory to erase ancient hatreds and make a nation whole."

But as she moves from the simple Potage Parmentier (potato soup) into the more complicated realm of aspics and crépes, she realizes there’s more to Mastering the Art of French Cooking than meets the eye. With Julia’s stern warble always in her ear, Julie haunts the local butcher, buying kidneys and sweetbreads. She sends her husband on late-night runs for yet more butter and rarely serves dinner before midnight. She discovers how to mold the perfect Orange Bavarian, the trick to extracting marrow from bone, and the intense pleasure of eating liver. <br /><br />And somewhere along the line she realizes she has turned her kitchen into a miracle of creation and cuisine. She has eclipsed her life’s ordinariness through spectacular humor, hysteria, and perseverance."
Q215894,Candide,Voltaire,1966,176,218162,220,3.77,"<i>Candide</i> is the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in ""the best of all possible worlds."" On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that -- contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss -- all is not always for the best. Alive with wit, brilliance, and graceful storytelling, <i>Candide</i> has become Voltaire's most celebrated work."

Q215983,The Grapes of Wrath,John Steinbeck,1939,585,752153,8020,3.97,"Although it follows the movement of thousands of men and women and the transformation of an entire nation, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" is also the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads, who are driven off their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California.

This Faust-like and magical story is evidence of Hesse's searching philosophy and extraordinary sense of humanity as he tells of the humanization of a middle-aged misanthrope. Yet this novel can also be seen as a plea for rigorous self-examination and an indictment of the intellectual hypocrisy of the period.

Q2252261,Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles,Anthony Swofford,2003,261,8803,30,3.66,"Anthony Swofford's ""Jarhead"" is the first Gulf War memoir by a frontline infantry marine, and it is a searing, unforgettable narrative.When the marines -- or ""jarheads,"" as they call themselves -- were sent in 1990 to Saudi Arabia to fight the Iraqis, Swofford was there, with a hundred-pound pack on his shoulders and a sniper's rifle in his hands. It was one misery upon another. He lived in sand for six months, his girlfriend back home betrayed him for a scrawny hotel clerk, he was punished by boredom and fear, he considered suicide, he pulled a gun on one of his fellow marines, and he was shot at by both Iraqis and Americans. At the end of the war, Swofford hiked for miles through a landscape of incinerated Iraqi soldiers and later was nearly killed in a booby-trapped Iraqi bunker.<br /><br />Swofford weaves this experience of war with vivid accounts of boot camp (which included physical abuse by his drill instructor), reflections on the mythos of the marines, and remembrances of battles with lovers and family. As engagement with the Iraqis draws closer, he is forced to consider what it is to be an American, a soldier, a son of a soldier, and a man.<br /><br />Unlike the real-time print and television coverage of the Gulf War, which was highly scripted by the Pentagon, Swofford's account subverts the conventional wisdom that U.S. military interventions are now merely surgical insertions of superior forces that result in few American casualties. ""Jarhead"" insists we remember the Americans who are in fact wounded or killed, the fields of smoking enemy corpses left behind, and the continuing difficulty that American soldiers have reentering civilian life.<br /><br />A harrowing yet inspiring portrait of atormented consciousness struggling for inner peace, ""Jarhead"" will elbow for room on that short shelf of American war classics that includes Philip Caputo's ""A Rumor of War"" and Tim O'Brien's ""The Things They Carried,"" and be admired not only for the raw beauty of its prose but also for the depth of its pained heart."

A murder that Lou is determined to avenge--and if innocent people have to die in the process, well, that's perfectly all right with him.<br /><br />In <i>The Killer Inside Me</i>, Thompson goes where few novelists have dared to go, giving us a pitch-black glimpse into the mind of the American Serial Killer years before Charles Manson, John Wayne Gacy, and Brett Easton Ellis's <i>American Psycho</i>, in the novel that will forever be known as the master performance of one of the greatest crime novelists of all time."
Q2276817,Moderato Cantabile,Marguerite Duras,1985,122,3921,114,3.51,"A distressed young man murders the woman he loves in a café, watched by a large crowd. Fascinated by the crime she has witnessed, Anne Desbaresdes returns several times to the scene, forming a relationship with a man who also saw the murder, and drinking through the afternoon with him as he patiently answers her eager questions. Slowly, they find themselves being taken over by forces which threaten their own stability.<br /><br />Moderato Cantabile is a carefully woven tapestry of emotion, in which the characters' inner lives are reflected by the story's spaces and landscapes."
Q2277829,Catriona,Robert Louis Stevenson,1972,307,1291,2,3.63,"David Balfour is no sooner back in Edinburgh and restored to his estate than he is caught up in the aftermath of the Appin murder. Since he was present when the crime was committed, he knows that the accused, James Stewart, is innocent. Determined to testify on his behalf, David is waylaid yet again and thrust upon a further series of adventures. He meets the son of Rob Roy Macgregor, and falls in love with his daughter Catriona. The romance between David and Catriona is passionate but beset with problems.<br /><br />Alan Breck, David Balfour’s mentor and collaborator in <i>Kidnapped</i>, becomes involved in an attempt to unite the lovers and it is on this note of hope that the adventure enters its final chapters. Catriona is the immediate sequel to <i>Kidnapped</i>, which Stevenson had always planned, although it took eight years to appear. The book is not as well known as Kidnapped, yet it was one of Stevenson’s own favourites. He considered it to be his ‘high water mark’, saying that he would ‘never do a better book’."

Q2284057,"Girl, Interrupted",Susanna Kaysen,1994,192,175909,3733,3.9,"In 1967, after a session with a doctor she'd never seen before, eighteen-year-old Susanna Kaysen was put in a taxi to McLean Hospital. She spent most of the next two years on the ward for teenage girls in a psychiatric hospital that was as renowned for its famous clientele - Sylvia Plath, Robert Lowell, James Taylor, and Ray Charles were among its patients - as for its progressive methods of treating those who could afford its rare sanctuary. In a series of spare, razor-sharp vignettes marked by startling black humor, ""Kaysen writes as lucidly about the dark jumble inside her head as she does about the hospital routines, the staff, the patients."" (Kirkus Reviews) Through her own experiences (augmented by pages from her medical record) and those of her fellow patients, Kaysen opens up the world of the hospital and questions the social and emotional assumptions that divide people into deviant or normal. More than a story of young women and madness, Girl, Interrupted is a brilliant evocation of a ""parallel universe"" set within the kaleidoscopically shifting landscape of the late sixties. It is a clear-sighted, unflinching historical document that gives lasting and specific dimension to our definitions of mental illness and recovery."

Q2320903,Fantastic Mr. Fox,Roald Dahl,1970,81,102843,2564,4.06,"In the tradition of <i>The Adventures of Peter Rabbit</i>, this is a ""garden tale"" of farmer versus vermin, or vice versa. The farmers in this case are a vaguely criminal team of three stooges: ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean / One fat, one short, one lean. / These horrible crooks / So different in looks / Were nonetheless equally mean."" Whatever their prowess as poultry farmers, within these pages their sole objective is the extermination of our hero--the noble, the clever, the Fantastic Mr. Fox. Our loyalties are defined from the start; after all, how could you cheer for a man named Bunce who eats his doughnuts stuffed with mashed goose livers? As one might expect, the farmers in this story come out smelling like ... well, what farmers occasionally do smell like.<p> This early Roald Dahl adventure is great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds, who will be delighted to hear that Mr. Fox keeps his family one step ahead of the obsessed farmers. When they try to dig him out, he digs faster; when they lay siege to his den, he tunnels to where the farmers least expect him--their own larders! In the end, Mr. Fox not only survives, but also helps the whole community of burrowing creatures live happily ever after. With his usual flourish, Dahl evokes a magical animal world that, as children, we always knew existed, had we only known where or how to look for it. <i>(Great read aloud for any age; written at a 9- to 12-year-old reading level)</i></p>"
Q2328959,"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, #1)",Jean M. Auel,1984,257,224463,4451,4.05,"When her parents are killed by an earthquake, 5-year-old Ayla wanders through the forest completely alone. Cold, hungry, and badly injured by a cave lion, the little girl is as good as gone until she is discovered by a group who call themselves the Clan of the Cave Bear. This clan, left homeless by the same disaster, have little interest in the helpless girl who comes from the tribe they refer to as the ""Others."" Only their medicine woman sees in Ayla a fellow human, worthy of care. She painstakingly nurses her back to health--a decision that will forever alter the physical and emotional structure of the clan. Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by this outsider, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.<p> Although Jean Auel obviously takes certain liberties with the actions and motivations of all our ancestors, her extensive research into the Ice Age does shine through--especially in the detailed knowledge of plants and natural remedies used by the medicine woman and passed down to Ayla. Mostly, though, this first in the series of four is a wonderful story of survival. Ayla's personal evolution is a compelling and relevant tale. <i>--Sara Nickerson</i></p>"
Q23307577,Scarface,Armitage Trail,2005,140,428,0,3.74,"Maurice Coons, writing under the pseudonym Armitage Trail, gathered the elements for 'Scarface' when living in Chicago, where he became acquainted with many local Sicilian gangs. He prowled the murky streets of Chicago's gangland with a friend every night for two years, returning home to put to paper and write a book which somewhat documented his experiences. The resulted novel was 'Scarface', and it was worth the effort. Not just a thinly disguised biography of Al Capone, 'Scarface' is a gangster tale surprisingly rich with character and atmosphere. The story moves at a cracking pace, and from the machine guns, brutal deaths and beautiful gals emerges the tragic tale of one man's downfall from his ruthless ambition and love for friend and family.

The shy, unmarried Yukiko is a hostage to her family’s exacting standards, while the spirited Taeko rebels by flinging herself into scandalous romantic alliances and dreaming of studying fashion design in France. Filled with vignettes of a vanishing way of life, <i>The Makioka Sisters</i> is a poignant yet unsparing portrait of a family—and an entire society—sliding into the abyss of modernity.

The introduction gives the history of the composition of Conrad's first book, which was started in London in the autumn of 1889 and completed four and a half years later; the manuscript went with him to the Congo, Australia, the Ukraine, Belgium, Switzerland and France on his travels as a seaman and on holiday. During this long gestation, some of the chapters were typed twice, and later Conrad's slightly foreign English was tidied several times by publishers. The novel has suffered seven layers of unauthorized intervention, as set out in the essay on the text and the apparatus. The notes explain Malay terms and historical references, and there are two regional maps. This is the text of Almayer's Folly, established through modern textual scholarship, as Conrad would have liked it to have appeared in 1895."

Q2499287,Cold Mountain,Charles Frazier,1998,15,220377,5005,3.86,"This unabridged audio version of <i>Cold Mountain</i>, read by author Charles Frazier, deserves at least as much acclaim as the bestselling print edition, which won the National Book Award. The tale chronicles a Confederate army deserter's search for home and love in the last days of the Civil War.<p> Much has been made of the story's homage to <i>The Odyssey</i>, the origins of which are found in an oral tradition. One can't help but hear echoes of Homer when listening to Frazier's soft, deliberate voice give life to his lyrical writing and to his understated, yet convincing rendering of the overwhelming events of war. Both Frazier's prose and reading are leisurely, recalling a slow foot pace. His delivery is uniquely suited to Innman's arduous, adventure-filled walk toward home and to the possibility of a reunion with Ada, the woman he loves. The author's reading does equal justice to Ada, who is being transformed by her struggle for survival on her father's farm. There is precious little dialogue, and Frazier makes no effort at acting out the characters.</p><p> One small irritation in the production is a beeping noise at the end of each side. Another minor complaint is that the tapes don't have individual boxes, which was perhaps an attempt to make the overall package appear more booklike. The recording does, however, make deft use of two brief musical interludes. In a subtle twist, the fiddle music that opens the first cassette, when repeated as an accompaniment to the epilogue, carries a bittersweet and unexpected resonance. By all means, forgive Random House Audio the tiny glitches, pass over that slender abridged version, and take home the real thing. This audiocassette is a journey that will leave few listeners unchanged by the experience. (Running time: 14.5 hours, 12 cassettes) <i>--Naomi J. Cohn</i> </p>"

Lotte in Weimar is a vivid dual portrait—a complex study of Goethe and of Lotte, the still-vivacious woman who in her youth was the model for Charlotte in Goethe's widely-read The Sorrows of Young Werther. Lotte's thoughts, as she anticipates meeting Goethe again after forty years, and her conversations with those in Weimar who knew the great man, allow Mann to assess Goethe's genius from many points of view."

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love."

Worse, not a single person—family, colleague, or doctor—can vouch for him. Worse still, the impostor shares all of Martin's memories, experiences, and knowledge, down to the last detail. He is, in fact, a more convincing Martin than Martin himself. Is it a conspiracy? Amnesia?

Q279676,Michael Kohlhaas,Heinrich von Kleist,1993,133,3638,116,3.55,"""Michael Kohlhaas"" is a novella written by famed writer Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811). The story is based upon the historical figure of Hans Kohlhase, a 16th century merchant who turned violent after being attacked and victimized by the authorities. As a result, he gathered around him a band of criminals and spread terror throughout the whole of Saxony. --- ""The novella is a good example of Kleist's excellent narrative art: The action can be summed up in a few words, such as the formula for this story, given expressly on its first page: 'His sense of justice made him a robber and a murderer.' There is no leisurely exposition of time, place, or situation; all the necessary elements are given concisely in the first sentences. The action develops logically, with effective use of retardation and climax, but without disturbing episodes; and the reader is never permitted to forget the central theme. The descriptive element is realistic, with only pertinent details swiftly presented, often in parentheses, while the action moves on. The characterization is skilfully indirect, through unconscious action and speech. The author does not shun the trivial or even the repulsive in detail, nor does he fear the most tragic catastrophes ... The whole work in all its parts is firmly and finely forged by a master workman. --- Kleist has remained a solitary figure in German literature. Owing little to the dominant literary influences of his day, he has also found few imitators. Two generations passed before he began to come into his heritage of legitimate fame. Now ... his place is well assured among the greatest dramatic and narrative authors of Germany."" (John S. Nollen)"

Q2911356,Borstal Boy,Brendan Behan,1990,384,2204,19,3.99,"In 1939, Liverpool, 16 year-old Brendan Behan is arrested for carrying explosives in his suitcase. A fervent republican undergoing a mission for the IRA, with designs to blow up a shipyard, Behan is sentenced to three years Borstal detention as he is a minor, and cannot be given the death sentence.<br />In this autobiography, Behan writes about the experiences that ultimately shaped the man he was to become."
Q2911967,Ella Enchanted,Gail Carson Levine,1997,232,377435,8850,3.98,"At birth, Ella is inadvertently cursed by an imprudent fairy named Lucinda, who bestows on her the ""gift"" of obedience. Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery, trying to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you've ever read.<p> Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. <i>Ella Enchanted</i> has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor. (Ages 9 to 14) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>"

Q2920448,Enduring Love,Ian McEwan,1998,259,37110,1524,3.63,"In one of the most striking opening scenes ever written, a bizarre ballooning accident and a chance meeting give birth to an obsession so powerful that an ordinary man is driven to the brink of madness and murder by another's delusions.

Nombre d'entre eux sont arrêtés, traduits devant le conseil de guerre. Conan est prêt à faire l'impossible pour les sauver. Mais quel destin peuvent espérer ces soldats familiers du danger et de l'action violente, désorientés par la paix ?<br />Roger Vercel (1894-1957) puisa dans ses propres souvenirs de la Grande Guerre pour écrire ce roman, qui obtint le prix Goncourt en 1934. Illustrant les thèmes éternels de la camaraderie militaire, du désarroi des guerriers rendus à la vie ordinaire, Capitaine Conan demeure un des grands classiques du roman de guerre et d'aventures."
Q2943614,What Maisie Knew,Henry James,1998,336,5382,24,3.41,"<i>What Maisie Knew</i> is Henry James's damning portrait of adultery, jealousy and possession on the decadent fringe of English upper-class society. This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Christopher Ricks.<br /><br />After her parents' bitter divorce, young Maisie Farange finds herself turned into a 'little feathered shuttlecock' to be swatted back and forth by her selfish mother, Ida, and her vain father, Beale, who value her only as a means of provoking one another. When both take lovers and remarry, Maisie - solitary, observant and wise beyond her years - is drawn into an entangled adult world of intrigue and sexual betrayal, until she is at last able to cooperate in choosing her own future. As time conquers innocence, Henry James masterfully portrays Maisie's consciousness developing from simple childlike 'wonder' to a rich, morally-scrupulous adult mind.<br /><br />This edition of <i>What Maisie Knew </i>includes a chronology, suggested further reading, three contemporary reviews, Henry James's own commentaries on the work, and an introduction that examines how children figured in his predecessors' novels, and how war is waged between the sexes in <i>What Maisie Knew</i>.<br /><br />Henry James (1843-1916) son of a prominent theologian, and brother to the philosopher William James, was one of the most celebrated novelists of the <i>fin-de-siècle</i>. In addition to many short stories, plays, books of criticism, biography and autobiography, and much travel writing, he wrote some twenty novels.<br />His novella 'Daisy Miller' (1878) established him as a literary figure on both sides of the Atlantic, and his other novels in Penguin Classics include <i>Washington Square</i> (1880), <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i> (1881), <i>The Awkward Age</i> (1899), <i>The Wings of the Dove </i>(1902), <i>The Ambassadors</i> (1903) and <i>The Golden Bowl</i> (1904)<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>What Maisie Knew</i>, you might like Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'Embodies everything that James excelled at in fiction'<br />Paul Theroux"

Q2944381,August: Osage County,Tracy Letts,2008,138,15011,708,4.19,"One of the most bracing and critically acclaimed plays in recent history, <i>August: Osage County</i> is a portrait of the dysfunctional American family at its finest—and absolute worst. When the patriarch of the Weston clan disappears one hot summer night, the family reunites at the Oklahoma homestead, where long-held secrets are unflinchingly and uproariously revealed. The three-act, three-and-a-half-hour mammoth of a play combines epic tragedy with black comedy, dramatizing three generations of unfulfilled dreams and leaving not one of its thirteen characters unscathed."
Q29478,Faust,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,1950,291,57829,616,3.9450000000000003,"Goethe’s Faust reworks the late medieval myth of a brilliant scholar so disillusioned he resolves to make a contract with Mephistopheles. The devil will do all he asks on Earth and seeks to grant him a moment in life so glorious that he will wish it to last forever. But if Faust does bid the moment stay, he falls to Mephisto and must serve him after death. In this first part of Goethe’s great work, the embittered thinker and Mephistopheles enter into their agreement, and soon Faust is living a rejuvenated life and winning the love of the beautiful Gretchen. But in this compelling tragedy of arrogance, unfulfilled desire, and self-delusion, Faust heads inexorably toward an infernal destruction.<br /><br />The best translation of Faust available, this volume provides the original German text and its English counterpart on facing pages. Walter Kaufmann's translation conveys the poetic beauty and rhythm as well as the complex depth of Goethe's language. Includes Part One and selections from Part Two."

Q2992451,Confessions of a Crap Artist,Philip K. Dick,1982,272,4330,9,3.68,"Confessions of a Crap Artist is one of Philip K. Dick's weirdest and most accomplished novels. Jack Isidore is a crap artist -- a collector of crackpot ideas (among other things, he believes that the earth is hallow and that sunlight has weight) and worthless objects, a man so grossly unequipped for real life that his sister and brother-in-law feel compelled to rescue him from it. But seen through Jack's murderously innocent gaze, Charlie and Juddy Hume prove to be just as sealed off from reality, in thrall to obsessions that are slightly more acceptable than Jack's, but a great deal uglier."

Now, nine years later, living alone in Hollywood, even without his wife and kids, his life and success are still reasonably sweet. Top-of-the-chart ratings, good-natured casual affairs, and special vacations with his two young sons. His life is in perfect balance, he thinks. <br />Adrian Townshed thought she had everything: a job she liked as a TV production assistant and a handsome husband who was a rising star in his own field. In as enviable life they'd worked hard for--the American Dream. Until she got pregnant. Suddenly all she had was chaos. And Steven's ultimatum. Him or the baby. The question was: did he mean it? He did. <br />Bill Thigpen and Adrian Townshed collided in a supermarket. And the very sight of her suddenly makes him want more in his life.... a woman he really loves, a real family again. But does he need the heartache of another man's baby, another wife? Neither does. But they couldn't help it. <br />Danielle Steel touches the Heartbeat of two wonderful people as their friendship deepens into love, as they meet the obstacles that life presents with humor, humanity, and courage."
Q3011281,Jacquou le croquant,Eugène Le Roy,2008,403,118,6,3.46,"C'est un obscur fonctionnaire de Montignac, en Dordogne - Eugène Le Roy -, qui réalisera, vingt ans après la mort de Michelet, le voeu célèbre de l'historien d'écrire un livre populaire : un livre qui s'adresse au peuple, lui raconte son histoire, exprime sa révolte à l'égard des puissants qui l'oppriment et son inquiétude face à la disparition du monde rural et des modes de vie traditionnels. Dans une œuvre à la fois naïve et colorée, sombre et cruelle, Le Roy met la fiction au service de la mémoire collective. Il offre, en même temps qu'un document sur la vie rurale - symbole de toutes les souffrances paysannes dans le bas Périgord au début du XIXe siècle -, un roman d'aventures militant, dans lequel le discours sur la France de cette époque double en permanence le récit d'une révolte paysanne sous la Restauration ; un conte auquel ne manquent ni les loups ni les sorcières, mais un conte politique, animé par la revendication de justice sociale et traversé par le souffle immense de l'épopée révolutionnaire."

Q3043384,Deliverance,James Dickey,1971,262,29664,1083,3.88,"<div>
  <div>
    <p>The writing of the screenplay became an intense and extremely stimulating sort of game in which, with a camera in the hands of God rather than any mortal cinemaphotographer, I wrote the scenes one after the other as I would like to have them be.”from the <i>Afterword</i></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>This is the original screenplay that Dickey submitted to Warner Brothers. He had begun it with the idea of creating a work that would stand on its own as a work of art and still enhance and deepen the audience’s apprehension of their indi­vidual experience of <i>Deliverance </i>and its special meaning to them. When he sent this screenplay to Warner Brothers it was with a sense of having accomplished that goalI was convinced I had put down on paper what I wanted to happen on the screen, no matter who the director was, or the actors, or any of the rest of the crew.”</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>But while acknowledging the creativity, bravery, and dedica­tion of John Boorman and the actors and the crew who made the film version of <i>Deliverance, </i>Dickey also states that their real­ization is not the film as he would have had it. That film exists only in his imagination and within this screenplay. The story as filmed is presented in twenty-two production stills that speak of the undeniable strengths of the production that received nomi­nations from the Motion Picture Academy for its awards of best picture, best direction, and best editing. Arthur Knight de­scribed the film as one of those rare films that resonates like a literary work but thatrarer stillavoids either being or sounding literary.” Dickey concludes his <i>Afterword </i>with an invi­tation to the reader to show [the screenplay] in the wide­screen theater of his mind and compare it with the version he has seen in actual theaters, or on television.”</p>

Fifteen-year-old Michael Berg becomes ill on the way home from school. A woman takes care of him. Later, the boy arrives at her home with a bunch of flowers to thank her. And then comes back again. Hanna is the first woman he has ever desired. But there is something slightly off-key about her. His questions about her family and her life go unanswered. One day Hanna simply disappears. Michael's life goes on, but he can't forget her. Years later, as a law student observing a trial in Germany, Michael is shocked to realize that the person in the dock is Hanna. The woman he had loved so passionately is a criminal. Much about her behavior during the trial makes no sense. But then, suddenly and terribly, it does — Hanna is not only obliged to answer for a horrible crime, she is also desperately concealing an even deeper secret. As the past erupts into the present — both Michael's past with Hanna, and the past of Germany itself — Michael must accept that he will never be free of either of them."

Das ""große historische Ritterschauspiel"" handelt von Graf Wetter vom Strahl, Kunigunde von Thurneck und dem angeblichen Heilbronner Bürgermädchen Katharina, genannt Käthchen, die jedoch in Wahrheit die Tochter des Kaisers ist. Das fünfaktige Ritterschauspiel nimmt im dramatischem Werk Kleists eine Sonderstellung ein, da er die märchenhafte Elemente der damals recht beliebten romantischen Ritterdramen aufgreift – sie aber auch an manchen Stellen parodierend überzeichnet – und sprachlich den Blankvers mit längeren Prosapassagen mischt. Kleist greift im Käthchen von Heilbronn zudem ein Thema auf, das in der Naturwissenschaft des beginnenden 19. Jahrhunderts lebhaft diskutiert wurde und auf großes Interesse stieß: den Somnambulismus bzw. das Schlafwandeln."

Ce qui facilite les manœuvres des Soubevran, le Papet et son neveu Ugolin. qui veulent lui racheter son domaine à bas prix...

Q3179227,Water for Elephants,Sara Gruen,2006,335,1372962,52918,4.09,"Jacob Jankowski says: ""I am ninety. Or ninety-three. One or the other."" At the beginning of <i>Water for Elephants</i>, he is living out his days in a nursing home, hating every second of it. His life wasn't always like this, however, because Jacob ran away and joined the circus when he was twenty-one. It wasn't a romantic, carefree decision, to be sure. His parents were killed in an auto accident one week before he was to sit for his veterinary medicine exams at Cornell. He buried his parents, learned that they left him nothing because they had mortgaged everything to pay his tuition, returned to school, went to the exams, and didn't write a single word. He walked out without completing the test and wound up on a circus train. The circus he joins, in Depression-era America, is second-rate at best. With Ringling Brothers as the standard, Benzini Brothers is far down the scale and pale by comparison. <p> <i>Water for Elephants</i> is the story of Jacob's life with this circus. Sara Gruen spares no detail in chronicling the squalid, filthy, brutish circumstances in which he finds himself. The animals are mangy, underfed or fed rotten food, and abused. Jacob, once it becomes known that he has veterinary skills, is put in charge of the ""menagerie"" and all its ills. Uncle Al, the circus impresario, is a self-serving, venal creep who slaps people around because he can. August, the animal trainer, is a certified paranoid schizophrenic whose occasional flights into madness and brutality often have Jacob as their object. Jacob is the only person in the book who has a handle on a moral compass and as his reward he spends most of the novel beaten, broken, concussed, bleeding, swollen and hungover. He is the self-appointed Protector of the Downtrodden, and... he falls in love with Marlena, crazy August's wife. Not his best idea. </p><p> The most interesting aspect of the book is all the circus lore that Gruen has so carefully researched. She has all the right vocabulary: grifters, roustabouts, workers, cooch tent, rubes, First of May, what the band plays when there's trouble, Jamaican ginger paralysis, life on a circus train, set-up and take-down, being run out of town by the ""revenooers"" or the cops, and losing all your hooch. There is one glorious passage about Marlena and Rosie, the bull elephant, that truly evokes the magic a circus can create. It is easy to see Marlena's and Rosie's pink sequins under the Big Top and to imagine their perfect choreography as they perform unbelievable stunts. The crowd loves it--and so will the reader. The ending is absolutely ludicrous and really quite lovely. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p>"
Q3182068,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,John Berendt,1994,386,220427,7608,3.92,"A sublime and seductive reading experience. Brilliantly conceived and masterfully written, this enormously engaging portrait of a most beguiling Southern city has become a modern classic.<br /><br />Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this hauntingly beautiful city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's sharply observed, suspenseful, and witty narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt skillfully interweaves a hugely entertaining first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.<br /><br />It is a spellbinding story peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the ""soul of pampered self-absorption""; the uproariously funny black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else."

And then there is Kate, the enigmatic German girl with the mysterious smile.<br /><br />Capricious, untamed and curiously innocent, Kate steals their hearts in turn, and so begins the moving and tender story of three people in love, with each other and with life. Francois Truffaut, whose film of the novel is one of cinema's greatest achievments, has called <i>Jules et Jim</i> ""a perfect hymn to love.""<br /><br /><b>Henri-Pierre Roché</b> devoted his life to the arts, numbering Duchamp, Brancusi, Braque, Satie and Picasso amongst his closest friends. <i>Jules et Jim</i>, an autobiographical novel, was originally published in France in 1953 and was followed by <i>Deux Anglaises et le Continent</i>, which Truffaut also made into a film.<br /><br />""A delightful account of people sharing and unsharing each other.""?<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>"
Q3192488,Kamouraska,Anne Hébert,1988,257,908,4,3.63,"Translated into seven languages, Kamouraska won the Paris book prize and was made into a landmark feature film by Claude Jutra. A classic of Canadian literature by the great Québecoise writer, Kamouraska is based on a real nineteenth-century love-triangle in rural Quebec. It paints a poetic and terrifying tableau of the life of Elisabeth d'Aulnières: her marriage to Antoine Tassy, squire of Kamouraska; his violent murder; and her passion for George Nelson, an American doctor. Passionate and evocative, Kamouraska is the timeless story of one woman's destructive commitment to an ideal love.<br /><br />Porté à l'écran par Claude Jutra, <i>Kamouraska</i> est considéré à juste titre comme l'un des chefs-d'œuvre de la littérature québécoise.

Q3202091,The Year of Living Dangerously,Christopher J. Koch,1978,296,1591,109,3.87,"In 1965, Indonesia's fantastic beauty conceals a grim atmosphere of tension and unease. Sukrano, the charismatic god-king, placates his impoverished subjects with threats of war and gestures of magnificence, declaring his love for the suffering peasants, his defiance of the whole Western world. This new year, he insists, will be the climax of his reign, the year of confrontation--THE YEAR OF LIVING DANGEROUSLY.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the sordid atmosphere of the Wayang Bar, beleagured Western newsmen take refuge from the seething streets of Jakarta and strike up unlikely friendships. Guy Hamilton, an ambitious Australian broadcaster, is thrown together with Billy Kwan, a brilliant and secretive Eurasian dwarf who is Guy's most effective cameraman. Hamilton is intrigued by Kwan, and is gradually drawn into the mysteries which enshroud Kwan's life. Why does Billy encourage Hamilton's affair with the English girl whom Kwan himself loves? And how genuine is Kwan's provocative admiration for President Sukarno?<br /><br />Characters and events in this masterful novel move against the background of a nation in crisis, in the exotic pattern of the wayang kulit, the Javanese shadow-show. Billy Kwan's secret life is revealed through his files--astounding dossiers where Kwan has recorded the activities of his friends and his own eccentric speculations.<br /><br />As violence engulfs the bankrupt government, Kwan builds impossible expectations around his two heroes: Sukarno will be the savior of his people; Hamilton will be the instrument of Kwan's fantasies. But when both heroes fail him, the tortured cameraman turns to desperate action, and Hamilton begins to grasp the pervasive mystery which had been at the core of his friend's ramblings all along."

Cada capítulo consta de un número variable de secuencias de corta extensión, que desarrollan episodios que están mezclados con otros que ocurren simultáneamente. De esta manera el argumento se rompe en multitud de pequeñas anécdotas. Lo importante es la suma de las mismas, que conforma un conjunto de vidas cruzadas, como las celdas de una colmena.<br /><br />El marco espacio-temporal es muy preciso: Madrid en unos días del año 1943, en plena posguerra. La historia se basa en un espacio novelesco reducido pero con bastantes personajes que intervienen poco en el transcurso de la obra y dan una visión social coral. De entre los trescientos personajes que aparecen, escasean tanto los de las clases más acomodadas como los de la clase obrera y sectores marginados, predominando la clase media baja, la pequeña burguesía venida a menos, cuyas ilusiones y proyectos de futuro son engañosos y cuyas miradas «jamás descubren horizontes nuevos», en una vida relatada como una «mañana eternamente repetida». La novela aparece como primera parte de una serie que había de llevar el título de «Caminos inciertos».<br /><br />La voluntad de reflejar con exactitud la realidad no supone la absoluta neutralidad del autor, que interviene de dos formas contradictorias. En la mayoría de los casos utiliza la técnica objetivista, es decir, se limita a mostrar, a describir desde fuera, sin penetrar en el interior de los personajes.

Alors moi qui depuis mon enfance vivais au jour le jour, ayant reçu d'ailleurs de moi-même et des autres une impression définitive, je m'aperçus pour la première fois, d'après les métamorphoses qui s'étaient produites dans tous ces gens, du temps qui avait passé pour eux, ce qui me bouleversa par la révélation qu'il avait passé aussi pour moi.

Q3230387,"Farewell, My Queen",Chantal Thomas,2002,242,795,58,3.36,"A woman whose function it once was to read books aloud to Marie Antoinette is haunted by the memory of her last days at the French court of Versailles, when Louis XVI’s magnificent palace succumbed to the irrepressible forces of revolution. Now exiled in Vienna, Madame Agathe-Sidonie Laborde looks back twenty-one years to the legendary opulence of Versailles and, overcome with nostalgia and remorse, discovers the full measure of her fascination with the Queen she served.<br /><br />Madame Laborde takes us within the château, meticulously reconstructing the 14th, 15th, and 16th of July 1789—terrifying days when the servants disappear and many of the courtiers flee. Versailles’ miniature universe, sparkling with every outward appearance of happiness and beauty, is brilliantly juxtaposed with the chaos that erupts. We witness the unraveling of the château’s dawn-to-dusk ritual and the rising panic of the Court as Versailles edges closer and closer to collapse. Madame Laborde herself flees the night of the sixteenth, escaping with the Queen’s favorite, Gabrielle de Polignac, and her once-powerful family.<br /><br />Transporting us to eighteenth-century France with the skill of a consummate storyteller, Thomas evokes the splendor of Versailles on the eve of its downfall. Her portrait of Marie-Antoinette and of Versailles—brought vividly to life by a wealth of detail—is an incomparable account of a lost world."

Q3232078,The Devils of Loudun,Aldous Huxley,1971,376,2238,111,3.9,"The Devils of Loudun is a historical narrative of supposed demonic possession, religious fanaticism, sexual repression &amp; mass hysteria which occurred in 17th century France surrounding unexplained events that took place in the small town of Loudun; particularly on Roman Catholic priest Urbain Grandier &amp; a convent of Ursuline nuns, who allegedly became possessed by demons after Grandier made a pact with Satan. The events led to several public exorcisms as well as executions by burning. The book, tho less known than Huxley's other novels is widely considered one of his best.<br /> Urbain Grandier was burned at the stake at Loudun on 8/18/1634. He was accused of seducing an entire convent of Ursuline nuns &amp; of serving the devil. Grandier was probably too promiscuous &amp; too insolent to peers. He'd antagonised the Mother Superior, Sister Jeanne of the Angels, when he rejected her offer to become spiritual advisor to the convent. He faced an ecclesiastical tribunal &amp; was acquitted. It was only after he had publicly spoken against Cardinal Richelieu that a new trial was ordered by the Cardinal. He was tortured, found guilty &amp; executed by being burnt alive but never admitted guilt. Huxley touches on aspects of the multiple personality controversy in cases of apparent demonic possession."

Q3233504,The Reivers,William Faulkner,1962,340,6474,320,3.79,"Dust cover: <i>The Reivers</i> is, with no reservations whatsoever, one of the funniest books in our literature. It is a comic classic that will be universally read and reread, not only today, but as far into the future as any fiction of our time can continue to delight, interest, and inform the world of tomorrow. To seasoned readers of William Faulkner, <i>The Reivers</i> will come as no surprise, for they are already aware that his great gift for comedy is one of the most brilliant facets of his genius. But to those readers who have only sampled his work, <i>The Reivers</i> will be an especial delight.<br /><br />To reveal too much of the plot would be a discourtesy to the reader, for this is a book which moves on the wheels of breathless suspense. It may be said, however, that one day in 1905 eleven-year-old Lucius Priest—certain to become one of the most cherished striplings in literature—""borrowed"" his grandfather's automobile, with the tacit connivance of two older friends: the part-Indian Boon Hogganbeck and Ned William McCaslin, a Negro. In that nostalgic day, their ensuing expedition in the car from Jefferson, Mississippi, to Memphis called for the fearless hardihood of pioneers. The account of the heroic trio's journey is as exciting as it is hilarious—but it is just a pale prelude to the adventures that await them in Memphis. These being when Ned—a long-shot gambler and manipulator of Homeric stature—trades Grandfather's car for a dubious race horse. How the three reivers* grapple with the ensuing crisis is the mainspring of the story. Beginning with a night of whispered conspiracy in Miss Reba's brothel (made famous by the authors <i>Sanctuary</i>), it ends only after a conflict with the law, and some of the most hair-raising and bizarre horse racing in the history of fact or fiction. <br /><br />The wild humor, the racy language, and the frenetic action will not, however, blind the perceptive reader to the fact that <i>The Reivers</i>, like all of William Faulkner's work, is also a book about moving and tender human relationships, with profound moral insights into human conduct.<br /><br />*reive (reave): take awya by stealth or force; plunder."
Q3234071,The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,Michael Chabon,2005,328,25344,1523,3.64,"The enthralling debut from bestselling novelist Michael Chabon is a penetrating narrative of complex friendships, father-son conflicts, and the awakening of a young man’s sexual identity. Chabon masterfully renders the funny, tender and captivating first-person narrative of Art Bechstein, whose confusion and heartache echo the tones of literary forebears like <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>’s HoldenCaulfield and <em>The Great Gatsby</em>’s Nick Carraway<em>. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh </em>incontrovertibly established Chabon as a powerful force in contemporary fiction, even before his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <em>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay </em>set the literary world spinning.

L'apparition de Martine, venue occuper un emploi de secrétaire après avoir mené à Paris une existence des plus libres, a d'abord été comme un grand souffle de liberté et de passion...

Q329989,Demons,Fyodor Dostoyevsky,1994,733,36752,705,4.27,"<i>Demons</i>, also known as <i>The Possessed</i> or <i>The Devils</i>, is a dark masterpiece that evokes a world where the lines between and good and evil long ago became blurred. This Penguin Classics edition of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's <i>Demons</i> is translated by Robert A. Maguire and edited by Ronald Meyer, with an introduction by Robert L. Belknap.<br /><br />Pyotr Verkhovensky and Nikolai Stavrogin are the leaders of a Russian revolutionary cell. Their goal is to overthrow the Tsar, destroy society and seize power for themselves. Together they train terrorists who are willing to go to any lengths to achieve their goals - even if the mission means suicide. But when it seems their motley group is about to be discovered, will their recruits be willing to kill one of their own circle in order to cover their tracks? As the ensuing investigation and trial reveal the true identity of the murderer, Dostoyevsky's and everyone's faith in humanity is tested. Partly based on the real-life case of a student murdered by his fellow revolutionaries, Dostoyevsky's sprawling novel is a powerful and prophetic, yet lively and often comic depiction of nineteenth-century Russia, and a savage indictment of the madness and nihilism of those who use violence to serve their inner beliefs.<br /><br />Robert A. Maguire's superb translation captures Dostoyevsky's vigorous prose. In his introduction, Robert L. Belknap discusses Dostoyevsky's own revolutionary activities, his narrative technique and use of different genres, and the background of Radicalism in Imperial Russia. Edited by Ronald Meyer, this volume also includes a chronology, further reading, notes and a glossary.<br />--back cover"

The pageantry and pretentious displays of excess were sufficient to cloy the senses of participants as well as to offend the sensitive.

Ligia, a captured King's daughter and a one-time hostage of Rome, is now a foster child of a noble Roman household. She's also a Christian.<br /> <br />The setting of the narrative was prepared with utmost care.

Naturally, Plimpton didn't make it as a football hero; he barely affords himself a dignified account of his performance on the field, which is just as well.

Desde menino, ouvia eu contar a triste história de meu tio paterno Simão António Botelho. Minha tia, irmã dele, solicitada por minha curiosidade, estava sempre pronta a repetir o facto aligado à sua mocidade. Lembrou-me naturalmente, na cadeia, muitas vezes, meu tio, que ali deveria estar inscrito no livro das entradas no cárcere e no das saídas para o degredo. Folheei os livros desde os de 1800, e achei a notícia com pouca fadiga, e alvoroços de contentamento, como se em minha alçada estivesse adornar-lhe a memória como recompensa das suas trágicas e afrontosas dores em vida tão breve. Sabia eu que em casa de minha irmã estavam acantoados uns maços de papéis antigos, tendentes a esclarecer a nebulosa história de meu tio. Pedi aos contemporâneos que o conheceram notícias e miudezas, a fim de entrar de consciência naquele trabalho. Escrevi o romance em quinze dias, os mais atormentados de minha vida. Tão horrorizada tenho deles a memória, que nunca mais abrirei o «Amor de Perdição», nem lhe passarei a lima sobre os defeitos nas edições futuras, se é que não saiu tolhiço incorrigível da primeira. Não sei se lá digo que meu tio Simão chorava, e menos sei se o leitor chorou com ele. De mim lhe juro que…»<br />Vão passados quase dois anos, depois que protestei não mais abrir este romance. […] Este livro, cujo êxito se me antolhava mau, quando eu o ia escrevendo, teve uma recepção de primazia sobre todos os seus irmãos. Movia-me à desconfiança o ser ele triste, sem interpolação de risos, sombrio, e rematado por catástrofe de confranger o ânimo dos leitores, que se interessam na boa sorte de uns, e no castigo de outros personagens. Em honra e louvor das pessoas que estimaram o meu livro, confessarei agradavelmente que julguei mal delas. […] O livro agradou como está.

Q370952,Pope Joan,Donna Woolfolk Cross,1996,422,64070,3825,4.08,"One of the most controversial women of history is brought to life in Donna Woolfolk Cross's tale of Pope Joan, a girl whose origins should have kept her in squalid domesticity. Instead, thru intelligence, indomitability &amp; courage, she ascended to the Roman throne as Pope John Anglicus. The time is 814, the place is Ingelheim, a Frankland village. It's the harshest winter in living memory when Joan is born to an English father &amp; Saxon mother. Her father is a canon, filled with holy zeal, capable of unconscionable cruelty. His piety doesn't extend to his family, especially females. His wife, Gudrun, is a young beauty to whom he's attracted beyond his will. He hates her for showing him his weakness. Gudrun teaches Joan about her gods &amp; is repeatedly punished for it by the canon. Joan grows to young womanhood with the combined knowledge of the warlike Saxon gods &amp; Church teachings as her heritage. When her brother John, not a scholarly type, is sent away to school, Joan, who was supposed to be the one sent to school, runs away &amp; joins him in Dorstadt, at Villaris, the home of Gerold. She falls in love with him. Their lives interesect repeatedly even thru her Papacy. She's looked upon by all who know that she's a woman as a ""lusus naturae,"" a freak of nature. ""She was... male in intellect, female in body, she fit in nowhere; it was as if she belonged to a 3rd amorphous sex."" The status of women in the Dark Ages was little better than cattle. They were judged inferior in every way &amp; necessary evils in the bargain. After John is killed in a Viking raid, Joan sees opportunity to escape the fate of her gender. She cuts her hair, dons her dead brother's clothes &amp; goes into the world as a young boy. Gerold is away from Villaris at the time of the attack &amp; comes home to find his home in ruins, his family killed &amp; Joan missing. After the attack, Joan goes to a Benedictine monastery, is accepted as a man of great learning &amp; eventually makes her way to Rome. <br /> Cross tells in an Epilogue that she wrote the story as fiction because it's impossible to document Joan's papal accession. The Catholic Church has done everything possible to deny this embarrassment. Whether or not one believes in Joan as Pope, this is a compelling story, filled with all kinds of lore: the brutishness of the Dark Ages, Vatican intrigue, politics, favoritism &amp; the place of women.--Valerie Ryan (edited)"

Q379015,Der Richter und sein Henker,Friedrich Dürrenmatt,1967,123,8644,26,3.73,"This volume offers bracing new translations of two precursors to the modern detective novel by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, whose genre-bending mysteries recall the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet and anticipate the postmodern fictions of Paul Auster and other contemporary neo-noir novelists. Both mysteries follow Inspector Barlach as he moves through worlds in which the distinction between crime and justice seems to have vanished. In The Judge and His Hangman, Barlach forgoes the arrest of a murderer in order to manipulate him into killing another, more elusive criminal. And in Suspicion, Barlach pursues a former Nazi doctor by checking into his clinic with the hope of forcing him to reveal himself. The result is two thrillers that bring existential philosophy and the detective genre into dazzling convergence."
Q3790778,Tough Guys Don't Dance,Norman Mailer,1984,240,2695,117,3.5,"A dark, brilliant novel of astonishing pitch, set in Provincetown, a ""spit of shrub and dune"" captured here in the rawness and melancholy of the off-season, ""Tough Guys Don't Dance"" is the story of Tim Madden, an unsuccessful writer addicted to bourbon, cigarettes, and blonde, careless women with money. On the twenty-fourth morning after the decampment of his wife, Patty Lareine, he awakens with a hangover, considerable sexual excitement, and, on his upper arm, a red tattoo bearing a name from the past. Of the night before, he remembers practically nothing. What he soon learns is that the front passenger seat of his Porsche is soaked with blood and that in a secluded corner of his marijuana stash in a nearby woods rests a blonde head, severed at the throat.<br />Is Madden therefore a murderer? He has no way of knowing. As in many novels of crime, the narrative centers on violence--physical, sexual, and emotional--but these elements move in their orbits through a rich constellation of character as Madden tries to reconstruct the missing hours of a terrible evening. In the course of this in-quiry a bizarre and vividly etched gallery of characters reappears to him as in a dream--ex-prizefighters, sexual junkies, mediums, former cons, a police chief, a world-weary former girl friend, and Mad-den's father, old now but still a Herculean figure, a practitioner of the sternest backroom ethics.<br />""Tough Guys Don't Dance"" represents Mailer at the peak of his powers with a stunningly conceived novel that soon transcends its origins as a mystery to become a relentless search into the recesses and buried virtues of the modern American male. Rarely, as many readers will discern, have the paradoxes ofmachismo and homosexuality been so well explored."

In Hollywood, Waugh enjoyed meeting Charlie Chaplin and Walt Disney (""the two artists of the place"") but complained about the accommodations, the quality of food and the lack of wine at meals, the relaxed dress and informal manners, and the small talk of service workers – ""the exact opposite of the English custom by which the upper classes are expected to ask personal questions of the lower"". His trip to Hollywood was successful, however, in a literary way. He wrote ""I found a deep mine of literary gold in the cemetery of Forest Lawn and the work of the morticians and intend to get to work immediately on a novelette staged there."" Forest Lawn's founder, Dr. Hubert Eaton, and his staff gave Waugh tours of the facility and introduced him to their field. Waugh also had a copy of Eaton's book ""Embalming Techniques"", which Waugh annotated with marginalia.

But his desire for freedom, independence, and adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and befriending raccoons. <p> Jean Craighead George, author of more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i>, created another prizewinner with <i>My Side of the Mountain</i>--a Newbery Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian Andersen Award Honor Book.

It's time, Barney decides, to present the world with his own version of events. <i>Barney's Version</i> is his memoir, a rambling, digressive rant, full of revisions and factual errors (corrected in footnotes written by his son) and enough insults for everyone, particularly vegetarians and Quebec separatists. <p> But Barney does get around to telling his life story, a desperately funny but sad series of bungled relationships. His first wife, an artist and poet, commits suicide and becomes--à la Sylvia Plath--a feminist icon, and Barney is widely reviled for goading her toward death, if not actually murdering her.

Q3847136,Marie Antoinette: The Journey,Antonia Fraser,2001,512,30929,155,3.93,"An utterly riveting and intensely moving book by one of the world’s finest biographers.<br /><br />Never before has the life of Marie Antoinette been told so intimately and with such authority. The eighteenth-century French queen whose excesses became legend, Marie Antoinette was blamed for instigating the French Revolution. In this lavishly illustrated biography, best-selling author Antonia Fraser portrays a woman whose journey from palace to guillotine was doomed by her innocence and the manipulations of the <i>ancien régime</i>.<br /><br />Antonia Fraser takes us behind the scenes to tell the story of the fourteen-year-old Archduchess of Austria’s arrival at the French court of Versailles, betrothed to the future King Louis XVI. Hostage to her mother Empress Maria Theresa’s foreign policy, Marie Antoinette was immediately accused of political interference by the French, yet she was not interested in state affairs, preferring to play a gracious, philanthropic role, patronizing the arts, especially music.<br /><br />Fraser weaves a richly detailed account of Marie Antoinette’s journey from an innocent, unsophisticated young girl into a magnificently courageous woman who, in the last days of the <i>ancien régime</i>, defied her enemies at her trial with consummate intelligence, arousing the admiration of even the most hostile revolutionaries.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, <b>Marie Antoinette</b> is a work of impeccable scholarship. Drawing on a wealth of letters and other archival materials, Antonia Fraser successfully avoids the hagiography of some of the French queen’s admirers and the misogyny of many of her critics."

Gravely injured, she’s brought to the hospital where her father, Timoteo, is a surgeon. As his daughter lies near death, the handsome, cultivated, eminently respectable Timoteo unpacks a sordid burden of sin and guilt he has long borne in silence.<br /><br />Fraught with sexual obsession, degradation, and devotion, his confession is the tale of a man who for his whole life has been “afraid to live”—with one passionate exception. Silently addressing Angela, Timoteo bares his soul, and the events of the year before her birth open like a wound.<br /><br />As Timoteo’s tale begins, he’s driving from the city to the beach house where his beautiful, accomplished wife, Elsa, is waiting for him. Car trouble forces him to make a detour into a dingy suburb, and there he meets Italia—unbeautiful, unpolished, working-class—who awakens a part of him he scarcely recognizes. Disenchanted with his stable life, he seizes the chance to act without consequences, and what ensues is startling and savage. Is it rape? Or something mutual, animal, completely new to him? Returning again and again to Italia’s dim hovel, he finds himself faced with a choice: a life of passion with Italia, or a life of comfort and predictability with Elsa.<br /><br />“Suddenly, driven by an absurd rebellious impulse, you look for the bones of the man you would have liked to be,” Timoteo explains to his unconscious daughter, as if asking forgiveness for preferring the passionate life he glimpsed so briefly.<br /><br />In vivid, intense, masterful prose, Margaret Mazzantini has crafted a tale that electrifies from start to finish, drawing us deep down into the darkness of primal passion.</p>"

Ma le stranezze per Piccadilly non finiscono qui. Nell’atmosfera elettrizzante della Grande Mela, strampalate macchinazioni si alternano a bizzarri tentativi di rapimento, sullo sfondo di una platea fatta di assurdi personaggi: un ragazzino cicciottello e insolente, una detective truce e diabolicamente strabica, una banda di letterati da strapazzo, un pugile suonato riciclatosi come istruttore di ginnastica, l’«inventore» di un rivoluzionario quanto improbabile esplosivo.

Someone is killing honeymoon couples on their first night together and nothing that we know about the killer is, we realise, entirely reliable: the connections between the victims are tenuous and the killer's method varies significantly. Intelligent, sensitive, tough cop Lindsay Boxer has problems of her own--a potentially fatal blood condition and a suspicion that she is falling for the intelligent divorced spin-doctor forced on her as partner by a publicity-conscious city government. The conversations she has with her friends are partly a matter of looking again at the results of legwork--sometimes explaining something to people who do not share your automatic assumptions makes you look at it again--and partly a matter of sharing expertise; rapidly they realise that they are up against someone for whom murder is a sexual game. Patterson has always had an eye for the psychology of killers--here he adds empathy for those to whom caring about victims is a way of life. --<i>Roz Kaveney</i>"

Q4003875,Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You,Peter    Cameron,2007,114,12391,952,3.68,"IN RE: James Sveck–eighteen-year-old New Yorker, charming, precocious, confused, doesn’t quite fit in (doesn’t really want to), <br />If: his future (i.e., college) seems completely meaningless, not to mention terrifying . . .  <br />Then: he’ll start anew (move to the Midwest?).<br />In re: James Sveck–misunderstood by a capricious mother, a self-absorbed father, a mordant older sister,<br />Et alia: his Teutonic therapist, his D-list celebrity grandmother, his unnervingly attractive art gallery colleague . . . <br />If: What one wants is enigmatic . . . <br />Then: Life can be hell.<br />But: as the summer gets hotter, James comes to recognize the wrenching truth of his emotions. <br /><br />James’s archly comic bravado fuels this sharply observed novel of a teen adrift in an adult world, struggling to make sense of the problems of love and of lack. The engaging voice of our idiosyncratic antihero is deftly captured by the adroit prose of Peter Cameron. Often hilarious, deeply compassionate, smart, and lyrical, <i>Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You</i> is every bit as sui generis as James Sveck himself. <br /><br />See also: Brown University; Sexual orientation (confusion thereof); Dinner theater; Poodles (standard)."

Q4009488,Vengeance,George Jonas,1985,408,1689,123,4.11,"In 1972, 11 Israeli athletes were murdered at the Munich Olympics. This is the chilling account of how they were avenged.<br /><br />First published in 1984, George Jonas’s #1 bestseller <em>Vengeance</em> has become a real-life espionage classic. The story of five ordinary young Israelis whose mission it was to hunt down and kill the terrorists responsible for the massacre of eleven athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, <em>Vengeance</em> plunges the reader into an explosive world of terrorism and political murder.<br /><br />This is an account of what happened when five idealistic volunteer agents were sent to track down and kill the central figures of the PLO's Munich operation, told from the point of view of ""Avner,"" a member of the team chosen to avenge the monstrous crime, and the first Mossad agent to come out of ""deep cover"" to tell his story. His description of the mechanics, the horrors and the unrelenting suspense of this mission surpasses the wildest fabrications of today’s blockbuster movies and bestselling crime thrillers. As these men moved from country to country, changing identities and risking their lives, they soon became targets themselves—tracked, hunted and even killed.<br /><br />A profoundly human story, <em>Vengeance</em> explores firsthand the revulsion and doubt that came to torment the Israeli agents, inexorably changing their view of the mission and ultimately how they felt about themselves. It is also a stark examination of the timeless concerns that continue to plague our consciousness today: the nature of good and evil, and the difference between right and wrong."

Q4010770,Leaving Las Vegas,John  O'Brien,1991,189,4127,7,3.95,"John O'Brien's books have established him as a writer who communicated the voice of the loner with blistering realness and unmistakable force. In Leaving Las Vegas, he wove a love story of incredible passion among two lost souls. In The Assault on Tony's, he unfolded a psychological drama among five drunks who spend their last days barricaded in a bar. Stripper Lessons is perhaps O'Brien's most interior and intense book, a powerful story of a man's obsessive search to belong.In Stripper Lessons, O'Brien details the dark and simple life of Carroll, a middle-aged, unmarried, friendless man whose only joy is watching beautiful women dance. Terribly shy and unable to socially: with the people around him, Carroll's fascination with the women at his favorite club is totally innocent; his desire for them is the desire to be connected. There, he finds solace in the routine, the rules, and the predictability of the action; inside, a dollar or two will win him affection. But when his desire for a particular dancer takes him one step too far, his entire life threatens to crumble.<br /><br />As he did in Leaving Las Vegas O'Brien has given life to the outcast and captured the hope and truthfulness that even the most simple lives are built on."

In fact, if she doesn't do it, it doesn't get done, from Little League carpool duty to analyzing portfolios to folding the laundry and bringing home the bacon. She does it all well, too, if her chic house, personal trainer, BMW, and her loving son are any indication. So what if there's been no one to share her bed with lately, let alone rock her world? Stella doesn't mind it too much; she probably wouldn't have the energy for love - and all of love's nasty fallout - anyway. <br /> But when Stella takes a spur-of-the-moment vacation to Jamaica, her world gets rocked to the core - not just by the relaxing effects of the sun and sea and an island full of attractive men, but by one man in particular. He's tall, lean, soft-spoken, Jamaican, smells of citrus and the ocean - and is half her age. The tropics have cast their spell and Stella soon realizes she has come to a cataclysmic juncture: not only must she confront her hopes and fears about love, she must question all of her expectations, passions, and ideas about life and the way she has lived it. <br /> Told in Stella's own exuberant, dead-on, dead honest voice, How Stella Got Her Groove Back is full of Terry McMillan's signature humor, heart, and insight. More than a love story, it is ultimately a novel about how a woman saves her own life - and what she must risk to do it."

Q428581,Possession,A.S. Byatt,1991,533,69094,3496,3.89,"""Literary critics make natural detectives,"" says Maud Bailey, heroine of a mystery where the clues lurk in university libraries, old letters, and dusty journals. Together with Roland Michell, a fellow academic and accidental sleuth, Maud discovers a love affair between the two Victorian writers the pair has dedicated their lives to studying: Randolph Ash, a literary great long assumed to be a devoted and faithful husband, and Christabel La Motte, a lesser-known ""fairy poetess"" and chaste spinster. At first, Roland and Maud's discovery threatens only to alter the direction of their research, but as they unearth the truth about the long-forgotten romance, their involvement becomes increasingly urgent and personal. Desperately concealing their purpose from competing researchers, they embark on a journey that pulls each of them from solitude and loneliness, challenges the most basic assumptions they hold about themselves, and uncovers their unique entitlement to the secret of Ash and La Motte's passion. <p> Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize--the U.K.'s highest literary award--<i>Possession</i> is a gripping and compulsively readable novel. A.S. Byatt exquisitely renders a setting rich in detail and texture. Her lush imagery weaves together the dual worlds that appear throughout the novel--the worlds of the mind and the senses, of male and female, of darkness and light, of truth and imagination--into an enchanted and unforgettable tale of love and intrigue. <i>--Lisa Whipple</i></p>"

The priests have been rounded up and forced to marry, abandoning their faith, or been put in front of a firing squad--save one, Padre José, the whisky priest. On the run, and in a blur of alcohol and fear, this fugitive meets a dentist, a banana farmer, and a village woman he knew six years earlier.

The narrative shifts effortlessly among multiple viewpoints within C-for-Charlie Company, from commanding officer Capt. James Stein, his psychotic first sergeant Eddie Welsh, and the young privates they send into battle. The descriptions of combat conditions—and the mental states it induces—are unflinchingly realistic, including the dialog (in which a certain word Norman Mailer rendered as ""fug"" 15 years earlier in <i>The Naked and the Dead</i> appears properly spelled on numerous occasions). This is more than a classic of combat fiction; it is one of the most significant explorations of male identity in American literature, establishing Jones as a novelist of the caliber of Herman Melville and Stephen Crane."

Q4551661,The Queen of Spades,Alexander Pushkin,2005,54,7968,192,3.94,"Pushkin, who was born in 1799 and died in 1838, is the founder of Russian literature, and it is difficult to overestimate his influence. He is the first, and still the most generally beloved, of all their national poets. The wild enthusiasm that greeted his verse has never passed away, and he has generally been regarded in Russia as one of the great poets of the world. Pushkin was, for a time at any rate, a Romantic, largely influenced, as all the world was then, by Byron. He is full of sentiment, smiles and tears, and passionate enthusiasms. He therefore struck out in a path in which he has had no great followers; for the big men in Russian literature are all Realists. Romanticism is as foreign to the spirit of Russian Realism as it is to French Classicism. What is peculiarly Slavonic about Pushkin is his simplicity, his naivete. Though affected by foreign models, he was close to the soil. This is shown particularly in his prose tales, and it is here that his title as Founder of Russian Literature is most clearly demonstrated. He took Russia away from the artificiality of the eighteenth century, and exhibited the possibilities of native material in the native tongue."

Er erschien erstmalig im Jahre 1905 und schildert die makabre Geschichte eines professoralen Gymnasiastenschrecks, einer Spießerexistenz, die in später Leidenschaft einer Kleinstadtkurtisane verfällt und aus den gewohnten bürgerlichen Bahnen entgleist.Mit diesem Roman, dessen Verfilmung mit Emil Jannings und Marlene Dietrich unter dem Titel ""Der blaue Engel"" zu einem der wenigen wirklichen Welterfolge des deutschen Films wurde, gelang Heinrich Mann eine meisterhafte Karikatur der Wilhelminischen Zeit."

Drifters in search of work, George and his simple-minded friend Lennie have nothing in the world except each other and a dream--a dream that one day they will have some land of their own.

Q4592142,The Last King of Scotland,Giles Foden,1998,340,3485,229,3.78,"Nicholas Garrigan has fled his native Scotland, and his parents' expectations, to take a position as a doctor in a remote rural outpost of Central Africa. Shortly after his arrival in Uganda, he is called to the scene of a bizarre car accident: Idi Amin, manically driving his red Maserati down the dirt tracks of Garrigan's small village, has run over a cow. Garrigan binds Amin's sprained wrist and puts the incident behind him, until a letter arrives from the Minister of Health informing him that Amin - in his obsession with all things Scottish - has appointed Garrigan his personal physician. Garrigan is instructed to settle into State House, on the grounds of Amin's residence, immediately. Later, Garrigan will reflect that had he known what awaited him, had he foreseen the terrifying concatenation of events this decision would set in motion, he would have boarded the first plane back to Scotland. He will wonder why it never occurred to him to simply say no. So begins Nick Garrigan's journey into a Conradian heart of darkness, as his own moral center battles weakly against, and then succumbs to, the dark and irresistible seductions of Idi Amin Dada, whose cruelty and cunning are masked by brilliant rhetoric, hilarious wit, and electrifying personal magnetism. When at last Nick awakens to the horrors of Amin's regime, he must awaken also to his own complicity in it - he cared for Amin, as a doctor and as a friend - and to the knowledge that he is both a traitor to his own country and a prisoner in his new one."

Q459667,The Murders in the Rue Morgue,Edgar Allan Poe,1996,64,25223,188,3.9,"""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham's Magazine in 1841. It has been claimed as the first detective story; Poe referred to it as one of his ""tales of ratiocination"". Similar works predate Poe's stories, including Das Fräulein von Scuderi (1819) by E.T.A. Hoffmann and Zadig (1748) by Voltaire.<br /><br />C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mysterious brutal murder of two women. Numerous witnesses heard a suspect, though no one agrees on what language was spoken. At the murder scene, Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human.<br /><br />As the first true detective in fiction, the Dupin character established many literary devices which would be used in future fictional detectives including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. Many later characters, for example, follow Poe's model of the brilliant detective, his personal friend who serves as narrator, and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it. Dupin himself reappears in ""The Mystery of Marie Roget"" and ""The Purloined Letter""."

His quest to solve the central mystery takes him down strange byways—old libraries and warehouse cellars, Welsh mountains and underground tombs."
Q460583,The Pickwick Papers,Charles Dickens,1973,815,24351,1031,3.83,"Charles Dickens’s satirical masterpiece, <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, catapulted the young writer into literary fame when it was first serialized in 1836–37. It recounts the rollicking adventures of the members of the Pickwick Club as they travel about England getting into all sorts of mischief. Laugh-out-loud funny and endlessly entertaining, the book also reveals Dickens’s burgeoning interest in the parliamentary system, lawyers, the Poor Laws, and the ills of debtors’ prisons. As G. K. Chesterton noted, “Before [Dickens] wrote a single real story, he had a kind of vision . . . a map full of fantastic towns, thundering coaches, clamorous market-places, uproarious inns, strange and swaggering figures. That vision was Pickwick.”"

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.<br /><br />Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.<br /><br />Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.<br /><br />Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.<br /><br />In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't. <br />(jacket flap)"

Q464921,Arch of Triumph,Erich Maria Remarque,1945,455,18968,296,4.41,"Erich Maria Remarque, der ""erfolgreichste, meistgelesene und meistangegriffene"" Autor der Gegenwart ist mit dem Roman <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> zum Thema seines ersten Werkes zurückgekehrt. Wieder stellt er der Sinnlosigkeit des Krieges, der brutalen Gewalt, der Willkür und dem Terror, den Menschen gegenüber, der ""nicht wußte, wohin er sollte"". Die Weltstadt an der Seine, gezeichnet von der 1938 beginnenden Weltkatastrophe, ist der erregende Hintergrund dieses aufwühlenden Zeit- und Emigrantenromans.<br /><br />Der deutsche Frauenarzt Dr. Ravic ist ohne Papiere der Gestapohaft entkommen. Nun lebt er verborgen in zweifelhaften Pariser Hotels und Nachtlokalen und führt illegal, gegen geringen Lohn, für französische Chirurgen schwierige Operationen an Frauen und Freudenmädchen aus. Die Zeit machte sie einander gleich: Ausgestoßenen und Flüchtlingen ist selbst die Unterwelt ein Mittel zum Überleben. Ravic — das ist der dritte Name, den der Chirurg seit der Flucht sich zulegen mußte — will überleben. Sein Haß auf den Gestapoagenten Haake und dessen Ermordung bilden den Kern der ebenso tragischen wie faszinierenden Handlung. Die erschütternde Liebe des Arztes zu Joan Madou, die ihr Leben verliert wie Ravics Gefährtin Kate, enthüllt aber auch das Menschliche jener Jahre, denn ""wenn einem nichts mehr heilig ist, wird einem alles auf eine menschliche Weise wieder heilig"". Noch im Untergang ist hier Bewährung, deren die anderen, ""die ewig Überlebenden"" nicht fähig sind, denn ""das Licht liebt sie nicht, diese Holzseelen, deshalb vergißt es sie und läßt sie lange leben"".<br /><br />Die tiefe Wahrhaftigkeit des Werkes stellt jeden Leser vor seine eigene Entscheidung, ""es wartet nirgendwo etwas, man muß alles immer selbst mitbringen"": jene Hoffnung und Kraft, die Remarque das Schicksal des heimatlosen Ravic aus der Achtung vor dem Menschen auch im Schatten der Macht gültig gestalten ließ."

Q465360,A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,James Joyce,1964,288,128129,3605,3.62,"The portrayal of Stephen Dedalus's Dublin childhood and youth, his quest for identity through art and his gradual emancipation from the claims of family, religion and Ireland itself, is also an oblique self-portrait of the young James Joyce and a universal testament to the artist's 'eternal imagination'. Both an insight into Joyce's life and childhood, and a unique work of modernist fiction, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is a novel of sexual awakening, religious rebellion and the essential search for voice and meaning that every nascent artist must face in order to fully come into themselves."

Q469690,Mansfield Park,Jane Austen,1971,432,284714,168,3.86,"Adopted into the household of her uncle, Sir Thomas Bertram, Fanny Price grows up a meek outsider among her cousins in the unaccustomed elegance of Mansfield Park. Soon after Sir Thomas absents himself on estate business in Antigua (the family's investment in slavery and sugar is considered in the Introduction in a new, post-colonial light), Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive at Mansfield, bringing with them London glamour, and the seductive taste for flirtation and theatre that precipitates a crisis. While <i>Mansfield Park</i> appears in some ways to continue where <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> left off, it is, as Kathryn Sutherland shows in her illuminating Introduction, a much darker work, which challenges 'the very values (of tradition, stability, retirement and faithfulness) it appears to endorse'.

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected.

However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. <br /> <br />The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences.

The first edition credited the work's protagonist Robinson Crusoe as its author, leading many readers to believe he was a real person and the book a travelogue of true incidents.<br /><br />Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is presented as an autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer), a castaway who spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers, before ultimately being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called ""Más a Tierra"", now part of Chile, which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966.<br /><br />Despite its simple narrative style, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. It is generally seen as a contender for the first English novel. Before the end of 1719, the book had already run through four editions, and it has gone on to become one of the most widely published books in history, spawning so many imitations, not only in literature but also in film, television and radio, that its name is used to define a genre, the Robinsonade."

It includes theories about UFOs, aliens, Men in Black, angels, demons, mutants, ghosts &amp; other paranormal phenomena, as well as the 12/15/67 collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River from Pt Pleasant to Gallipolis, OH. It also deals with strange occurences around the time that Mothman was sighted, such as odd phone calls, disasters &amp; mutilated pets. Keel claims that Mothman caused these events.<br /> The book involves Keel as a journalist, direct observer of some events &amp; also presents some fragments of memoir. It's been seen as an innovative work of creative nonfiction.

Schiller wrote many philosophical papers on ethics and aesthetics. He developed the concept of the Schone Seele (beautiful soul), a human being whose emotions have been educated by his reason, so that Pflicht und Neigung (duty and inclination) are no longer in conflict with one another; thus ""beauty,"" for Schiller, is not merely a sensual experience, but a moral one as well: the Good is the Beautiful. His philosophical work was also particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical researches. Schiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. Critics have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy. Amongst his famous works are Love and Intrigue (1784), Don Carlos (1787), The Minister (1796), The Death of Wallenstein (1799), The Piccolomini (1800) and Mary Stuart (1800)."

Isherwood magnificently captures 1931 Berlin: charming, with its avenues and cafés; marvelously grotesque, with its nightlife and dreamers; dangerous, with its vice and intrigue; powerful and seedy, with its mobs and millionaires—this is the period when Hitler was beginning his move to power. <em>The Berlin Stories</em> is inhabited by a wealth of characters: the unforgettable Sally Bowles, whose misadventures in the demimonde were popularized on the American stage and screen by Julie Harris in <em>I Am A Camera</em> and Liza Minnelli in <em>Cabaret</em>; Mr. Norris, the improbable old debauchee mysteriously caught between the Nazis and the Communists; plump Fräulein Schroeder, who thinks an operation to reduce the scale of her Büste might relieve her heart palpitations; and the distinguished and doomed Jewish family, the Landauers."

Q511143,The Trial of Henry Kissinger,Christopher Hitchens,2001,160,3159,189,3.96,"<i>“His own lonely impunity is rank; it smells to heaven.

In the name of innumerable victims known and unknown, it is time for justice to take a hand.”</i><br /><br />With the detention of Augusto Pinochet, and intense international pressure for the arrest of Slobodan Milosevic, the possibility of international law acting against tyrants around the world is emerging as a reality. Yet, as Christopher Hitchens demonstrates in this compact, incendiary book, the West need not look far to find suitable candidates for the dock. The United States is home to an individual whose record of war crimes bears comparison with the worst dictators of recent history. Please stand, ex-Secretary of State and National Security Advisor, Henry A. Kissinger. <br /><br />Weighing the evidence with judicial care, and developing his case with scrupulous parsing of the written record, Hitchens takes the floor as prosecuting counsel. He investigates, in turn, Kissinger’s involvement in the war in Indochina, mass murder in Bangladesh, planned assassinations in Santiago, Nicosia and Washington, D.C., and genocide in East Timor. Drawing on first-hand testimony, previously unpublished documentation, and broad sweeps through material released under the Freedom of Information Act, he mounts a devastating indictment of a man whose ambition and ruthlessness have directly resulted in both individual murders and widespread, indiscriminate slaughter."

Crackling dialogue, mordant humor, and unremitting tension drive the suspenseful stakes of the game higher in Boston's precarious underworld of small-time mobsters, crooked lawyers, and political gofers as George V. Higgins, the writer who boiled crime fiction harder, tracks Jackie Cogan's career in a gangland version of law and order. For Cogan is an enforcer; and when the Mob's rules get broken, he gets hired to ply his trade—murder. In the gritty, tough-talking pages of Higgins's 1974 national best-seller, Cogan is called in when a high-stake card game under the protection of the Mob is heisted. Expertly, with a ruthless businessman's efficiency, a shrewd sense of other people's weaknesses, and a style as cold as his stare, Cogan moves with reliable precision to restore the status quo as ill-conceived capers and double-dealing shenanigans erupt into high-voltage violence.

Q5239187,The Magnificent Ambersons,Booth Tarkington,1986,312,10006,533,3.77,"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize when it was first published in 1918, <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> chronicles the changing fortunes of three generations of an American dynasty. The protagonist of Booth Tarkington's great historical drama is George Amberson Minafer, the spoiled and arrogant grandson of the founder of the family's magnificence. Eclipsed by a new breed of developers, financiers, and manufacturers, this pampered scion begins his gradual descent from the midwestern aristocracy to the working class. Today <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> is best known through the 1942 Orson Welles movie, but as the critic Stanley Kauffmann noted, ""It is high time that [the novel] appear again, to stand outside the force of Welles's genius, confident in its own right."" ""<i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> is perhaps Tarkington's best novel,"" judged Van Wyck Brooks. ""[It is] a typical story of an American family and town--the great family that locally ruled the roost and vanished virtually in a day as the town spread and darkened into a city. This novel no doubt was a permanent page in the social history of the United States, so admirably conceived and written was the tale of the Amber-sons, their house, their fate and the growth of the community in which they were submerged in the end.""<br /><br />Booth Tarkington (1869-1946), a prolific writer who achieved overnight success with his first novel, <i>The Gentleman from Indiana</i> (1899), is perhaps best remembered as the author of the popular Penrod adventures and <i>Seventeen</i> (1916).

Beautifully written and action packed--RKO Radio Pictures even filmed this story--the novel depicts a flood so severe that it destroys modern civilization, leaving the few survivors to adapt to the rigors of the natural world. Like other English writers responding to the trauma of World War I, Sydney Fowler Wright expresses a loathing of the worst aspects of industrialization. The flood, in his view, becomes an opportunity for the remaking of society. The protagonists soon realize that civilization and technology have divorced them from the knowledge and skills necessary for survival. Released from their over-reliance on social regulation, they struggle to overcome their own brutality to develop a new sense of community. For over 75 years readers have praised this book for its style and wisdom, and debated the meaning of its controversial ending.

Q5284135,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,Rebecca Wells,1997,375,521827,3838,3.82,"<p><b>The Barnes &amp; Noble Review</b><br /><br />A powerfully literate yet thoroughly engaging and accessible novel, this story of a close-knit society of southern women has become a modern cult classic bolstered by author Rebecca Wells's abiltity to transcend standard-issue chick lit with bold and unique characters and a tale that digs deeply into the complex bonds of family.</p><br /><br /><p>The entangled story of actress Siddalee Walker, her mother Vivi, and Vivi's group of pals -- the Ya-Yas -- gets off to a heated start when Sidda's disparaging remarks about her mother run in the <i>New York Times.</i> Vivi declares all-out war and immediately cuts Sidda out of her will, pushes a libel suit, and forbids the other septuagenarian Ya-Ya's to speak to Sidda ever again. Convinced she doesn't ""know how to love,"" a shaken Sidda postpones her upcoming wedding and flees to a remote Washington cabin. Suddenly concerned about her daughter, Vivi convenes an emergency Ya-Ya council and at last decides to reveal her jealously guarded past to Sidda through her treasured scrapbook, ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood.""</p><br /><br /><p>The scrapbook spans Ya-Ya history, documenting among other things the hilarious Shirley Temple Look-Alike Contest that first united the four women in a conspiracy against polite society; the secret history and initiation rites of the group; a trip to Atlanta to attend the premier of <i>Gone With The Wind;</i> and Vivi's first and greatest love. It also sheds light on Vivi's reaction to the constraints of motherhood and the alcoholism, self-medication, and spiritual confusion that eventually led to a complete nervous breakdown. Also buried in the book is the key that unlocks Sidda's childhood memory of a lost lesson of love and brings her to a new understanding of her family's shared triumphs and tragedies.</p><br /><br /><p>Much more universal in its appeal than the ""women's book"" some reviewers have been tempted to call it (according to Wells, ""It's a book for women -- and <i>smart men""), The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood</i> manages with passion, humor, and an irrepressible gift for language to somehow show readers of all backgrounds a mirror-perfect reflection of their own life experiences. <i>(Greg Marrs)</i></p>"
Q529329,The Deputy,Rolf Hochhuth,1964,352,225,11,3.73,"Upon its premiere, The Deputy stirred up more controversy and caused greater repercussions than any other postwar work. Based on Rolf Hochhuth's research into the Vatican activities during World War II, the play's treatment of Pope Pius XII — the ""deputy"" of Christ on earth — and the Church during the Nazi persecution of the Jews made it the object of impassioned praise and violent denunciation. It is a powerful, shocking work that casts a penetrating eye on the role that supposed moral leaders must play in times of great humanitarian crises."
Q5296635,Donnie Brasco,Joseph D. Pistone,1990,368,6514,152,4.03,"When FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone began a “six-month” operation infiltrating New York’s Bonanno crime family in 1975, he had no idea what was about to happen. Posing as jewel thief “Donnie Brasco,” Pistone spent the next six years undercover in the Family, witnessing-and sometimes participating in-the Mafia’s gruesome activities while gathering enough evidence to send over 200 gangsters to jail. Pistone told his story in the 1988 book <i>Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia</i>-a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller and later a feature film starring Johnny Depp and Al Pacino. But because of pending trials at the time of publication, many details of the alleged crimes were held back. Now, in <i>Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business</i>, Pistone for the first time reveals with great detail the horrific deeds of wiseguys Tony Mirra, “Lefty” Ruggiero, Sonny Black, and the rest of the cold-blooded Bonanno crew. Pistone puts the operation into historical perspective, detailing the timeline of Mafia trials that crippled the New York City crime family over the past 25 years. He also recounts his experiences after the operation, his time on the Hollywood set with Pacino and Depp, and other undercover operations through present-day. A tense, thrilling account of the greatest infiltration ever by a federal agent into the most brutal gang of killers in the world, <i>Donnie Brasco: Unfinished Business</i> is the final chapter in the story of a real American hero."

Q5308061,Driving Miss Daisy,Alfred Uhry,1988,63,18992,106,4.26,"The place is the Deep South, the time 1948, just prior to the civil rights movement. Having recently demolished another car, Daisy Wertham, a rich, sharp-tongued Jewish widow of seventy-two, is informed by her son, Boolie, that henceforth she must rely on the services of a chauffeur. The person he hires for the job is a thoughtful, unemployed black man, Hoke, whom Miss Daisy immediately regards with disdain and who, in turn, is not impressed with his employer's patronizing tone and, he believes, her latent prejudice. But, in a series of absorbing scenes spanning twenty-five years, the two, despite their mutual differences, grow ever closer to, and more dependent on, each other, until, eventually, they become almost a couple. Slowly and steadily the dignified, good-natured Hoke breaks down the stern defenses of the ornery old lady, as she teaches him to read and write and, in a gesture of good will and shared concern, invites him to join her at a banquet in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. As the play ends Hoke has a final visit with Miss Daisy, now ninety-seven and confined to a nursing home, and while it is evident that a vestige of her fierce independence and sense of position still remain, it is also movingly clear that they have both come to realize they have more in common than they ever believed possible-and that times and circumstances would ever allow them to publicly admit."

In its grasp of life's frailty and its portrayal of one of the great literary romances of this century, <i>Elegy for Iris</i> is a mesmerizing work of art that will be read for generations."

Q538390,To Have and Have Not,Ernest Hemingway,1977,180,25255,33,3.56,"<i>To Have and Have Not</i> is the dramatic, brutal story of Harry Morgan, an honest boat owner who is forced into running contraband between Cuba and Key West as a means of keeping his crumbling family financially afloat. His adventures lead him into the world of the wealthy and dissipated yachtsmen who swarm the region, and involve him in a strange and unlikely love affair. <br /> In this harshly realistic, yet oddly tender and wise novel, Hemingway perceptively delineates the personal struggles of both the ""haves"" and the ""have nots"" and creates one of the most subtle and moving portraits of a love affair in his oeuvre. In turn funny and tragic, lively and poetic, remarkable in its emotional impact, <i>To Have and Have Not</i> takes literary high adventure to a new level. As the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> observed, ""Hemingway's gift for dialogue, for effective understatement, and for communicating such emotions the tough allow themselves, has never been more conspicuous."""

Former Navy flyer Stephen Coonts gives an excellent sense of the complexities of modern air raids and how nerve-wracking it is, even for the best airmen, to technically solve sudden problems over and over, knowing that even a twist of fate like a peasant wildly firing a rifle from a field could wipe out the crew. Grafton alternates between remorse over the fate of his unseen Vietnamese victims on the ground and a gung-ho ""let's win this war"" sentiment that lashes at both policymakers who select less-than-important targets for the dangerous missions and advocates for peace back in the States."

And just as he's thinking there's more to her than meets the eye, she's thinking that he's not quite all he seemed.<br /><br />This is a classic romantic comedy of errors told in alternating chapters by two fresh, funny voices.

After rescuing Mirah from an attempt to drown herself in the Thames, Deronda accompanies her on her quest into London’s Jewish community, which he finds unexpectedly appealing.

This revised edition includes expanded notes, appendices and suggestion for further reading by Helen Small, a chronology of Dickens's life and works, and original illustrations.<br /><br />Charles Dickens is one of the best-loved novelists in the English language, whose 200th anniversary was celebrated in 2012.

It's not long, though, before the Cuthberts can't imagine how they could ever do without young Anne of Green Gables--but not for the original reasons they sought an orphan. Somewhere between the time Anne ""confesses"" to losing Marilla's amethyst pin (which she never took) in hopes of being allowed to go to a picnic, and when Anne accidentally dyes her hated carrot-red hair green, Marilla says to Matthew, ""One thing's for certain, no house that Anne's in will ever be dull.""

Adapter M.C. Helldorfer includes only a few of Anne's mirthful and poignant adventures, yet manages to capture the freshness of one of children's literature's spunkiest, most beloved characters. There's just enough to make beginning readers want more--luckily, there's a lot more in the originals!

Q587945,Mephisto,Klaus Mann,1983,267,3578,94,4.005,"Klaus Mann - Thomas Mann’s son - wrote MEPHISTO while living in exile from the Germany of World War II. In it he captures the Isherwood-like atmosphere of Nazi Germany while telling a satiric story about the rise to power of one man - a thinly veiled caricature of his own brother-in-law. The man is Hendrik Hofgen, a character actor who in his own life plays a bizarre part in the elite circle of the Third Reich. Hofgen is publicly a revolutionary, but secretly he is a man driven by an obsessive need for power and fame. Although he benefits from the prestige of being married to the daughter of an eminent politician, he endangers his rise in Nazi society by his compulsive involvement with ‘a black Venus.’ His brilliant success as Mephisto in FAUST brings him the support of the Führer’s prime minister, who appoints him head of the State Theater. His dreams are finally realized, but the story ends on a note of despair as Hofgen is forced to confront the emptiness of his life. Mann weaves his tale with amazing skill. The result is a fascinating novel of decadence and evil.<br /><br />Klaus Mann, the second child of Thomas Mann, was born in Munich in 1906. He began writing short stories and articles in 1924, and within a year was a theatrical critic for a Berlin newspaper. In 1925 both a volume of short stories and his first novel, THE PIOUS DANCE, were published. His sister, Erika, to whom he was very close, was in the cast of his first play, ANJA AND ESTHER. Mann left Germany in 1933 and lived in Amsterdam until 1936, during which time he became a Czechoslovakian citizen, having been deprived of his German citizenship by the Nazis. He moved to America in 1936, living in Princeton, New Jersey, and New York City. He became a U.S. citizen in 1943. He died at the age of forty-two in Cannes, France. Robin Smyth was a European correspondent for the London Observer."

Q5909311,Hostage,Robert Crais,2001,384,7668,320,4.02,"Robert Crais is the real thing: a writer who keeps topping himself. Last year, after eight popular books featuring private eye Elvis Cole (including <i>L.A. Requiem</i> and <i>Voodoo River</i>), he produced <i>Demolition Angel</i>, his first standalone suspense novel. Its complex, multidimensional hero was a damaged cop haunted by her past failures. It worked in that book, and it works even better in this one.<p>Jeff Talley, the police chief in a small Southern California town, still has nightmares about the young hostage who died when he made the wrong call in his previous job as a negotiator for an LAPD SWAT team. Now, three smalltime punks go on the run after a grocery store robbery and killing in Talley's town. Soon his deputies have surrounded the house where the inept robbers have taken Walter Smith and his two children hostage, and Talley's back in his worst dream again: until the county sheriff's full-fledged SWAT team arrives and takes over, he has to negotiate for their lives.</p><p>Crais keeps the point of view moving from Talley to the punks to the hostages as the situation unfolds in the house and on the ground. Then he ratchets up the dramatic tension: there's something in Walter Smith's house that a ruthless Mob boss wants, and he'll sacrifice anyone to get it--which puts Talley's own family in danger. The action speeds to its climax with the velocity of a heat-seeking missile, which makes it almost criminal to slow down long enough to savor the great writing. Take this passage, from a scene when Talley's face-to-face with the man who's holding his own wife and daughter hostage:</p><p>Talley ... had stepped into the Zone. It was a place of white noise where emotions reigned and reason was meager. Anger and rage were nonstop tickets; panic was an express. He had been all day coming to this, and here he was: the SWAT guys used to talk about it. You went to the Zone, you lost your edge. You'd lose your career; you'd get yourself killed, or, worse, somebody else.</p><p>Crais belongs in that tier of writers whose novelistic gifts transcend the thriller category--writers like Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane, and James Lee Burke. <i>Hostage</i> is a breakout. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>"

A load of heroin and two million dollars in cash are still in the back. When Moss takes the money, he sets off a chain reaction of catastrophic violence that not even the law–in the person of aging, disillusioned Sheriff Bell–can contain.<br /><br />As Moss tries to evade his pursuers–in particular a mysterious mastermind who flips coins for human lives–McCarthy simultaneously strips down the American crime novel and broadens its concerns to encompass themes as ancient as the Bible and as bloodily contemporary as this morning’s headlines. <br /><i>No Country for Old Men</i> is a triumph."

Comment a-t-elle pu sortir d'une cellule fermée à clé de l'extérieur ? Le seul indice dont disposent Teddy et Chuck est une feuille de papier retrouvée dans la pièce.

Now this enormously gifted American writer has written his most remarkable novel yet, a matchless portrayal of a mother's devotion to the child who is both her burden and God's singular way of smiling on her.<br /><br />It is 1943 in the backwoods of Mississippi. In the land o honeysuckle and wild grapevine, Jewel Hilburn and her husband Leston - whose love for his wife is the surest comfort she's ever know - are truly blessed. They have five fine children who embrace the world as though it were a sumptuous table set for a feast; and when Brenda Kay is born, Jewel gives thanks for yet another healthy baby, last-born and most welcome. <br /><br />JEWEL is the story of how quickly a life can change; how, life lightning, an unforseen event can illuminate our lives and set us on a course without reason or compass. <br /><br />All too soon, Jewel knows that something is wrong with Brenda Kay; her every moment, every breath is taken up with caring for her daughter , with setting things straight. Leston's optimism is falling as fast as the Southern economy in the wake of the Second World War. And the physicians Jewel calls ""cracker doctors"" insist that no one can fix a brain born without the gift of common sense. <br /><br />Against a stunning tableau reminiscent of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, the uniquely talented Bret Lott traces the intricate changes among the members of the Hilburn family, as Jewel deepens her quarrel with God, taking hold of the hardships that come her way. Jewel sees one hope for them; they must travel to a new life in the Promised Land of California. <br /><br />In Los Angeles, their new Jerusalem, Jewel and Leston experience a slow but inevitable shifting of the heart. Brenda Kay delights in the huge, and by her own measure, heroic tasks that become triumphs for them all; the older Hilburn children begin the uncertain journey toward their own futures. <br /><br />We will wait a very long time before another writer matches the intensity and the beauty of this mother daughter relationship. JEWEL stands as an unforgettable masterwork, in which Bret Lott has created on of the finest and most indomitable heroines of contemporary American fiction."

Upon his return to his native Budapest still clad in his striped prison clothes, fourteen-year-old George Koves senses the indifference, even hostility, of people on the street. His former neighbors and friends urge him to put the ordeal out of his mind, while a sympathetic journalist refers to the camps as ""the lowest circle of hell."" The boy can relate to neither cliche and is left to ponder the meaning of his experience alone.<br /><br />George's response to his experience is curiously ambivalent. In the camps he tries to adjust to his ever-worsening situation by imputing human motives to his inhumane captors. By imposing his logic--that of a bright, sensitive, though in many ways ordinary teenager - he maintains a precarious semblance of normalcy. Once freed, he must contend with the ""banality of evil"" to which he has become accustomed: when asked why he uses words like ""naturally,"" ""undeniably,"" and ""without question"" to describe the most horrendous of experiences, he responds, ""In the concentration camp it was natural."" Without emotional or spiritual ties to his Jewish heritage and rejected by his country, he ultimately comes to the conclusion that neither his Hungarianness nor his Jewishness was really at the heart of his fate: rather, there are only ""given situations, and within these, further givens."""

If you like a novel that expertly puts you through the wringer, this is the one.' <br /><br />Hilary Wainwright, poet and intellectual, returns after the war to a blasted and impoverished France in order to trace a child lost five years before. The novel asks: is the child really his? And does he want him? These are questions you can take to be as metaphorical as you wish: the novel works perfectly well as straight narrative. Extraordinarily gripping: Little Boy Lost has the page-turning compulsion of a thriller, and is written with perfect clarity and precision.<br /><br />'Had it not got so nerve-wracking towards the end, I would have read it in one go. But Laski's understated assurance and grip is almost astonishing. She has got a certain kind of British intellectual down to a tee: part of the book's nail-biting tension comes from our fear that Hilary won't do something stupid. The rest of ""Little Boy Lost's"" power comes from the depiction of post-wr France herself. This is haunting stuff.'"

Butterfly </i>was an immediate sensation when it premiered in 1988. It opens in the cramped prison cell where diplomat Rene Gallimard is being held captive by the French government--and by his own illusions. He recalls a time when Song Liling, the beautiful Chinese diva, touched him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly.<br /><br />How could he have known that his true love was, in fact, a spy for the Chinese government--and a man disguised as a woman? The diplomat relives the twenty-year affair from the temptation to the seduction, from its consummation to the scandal that ultimately consumed them both.<br /><br /><i>M. Butterfly </i>is one of the most compelling, explosive, and slyly humorous dramas ever to light the Broadway stage, a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.<br /><br /><br /><br />The original cast included John Lithgow as Gallimard and BD Wong as Song Liling. During the show's 777-performance run, David Dukes, Anthony Hopkins, Tony Randall, and John Rubinstein were also cast as Gallimard. Hwang adapted the play for a 1993 film directed by David Cronenberg, starring Jeremy Irons and John Lone.<br /><br /><b>TEXT OF THE BROADWAY <b>REVIVAL</b></b>"

Q682733,The Castle,Franz Kafka,1969,318,42922,1004,3.96,"<b>Rewriting Kafka</b><p><br />Just before his death, in 1924, Franz Kafka sent a note to his friend Max Brod:<br /></p><p><br />""Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me...in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.... Yours, Franz Kafka""<br /></p><p><br />There's been much debate about this note ever since Brod published it in a postscript to the first edition of <i>The Trial</i>. Did Kafka really intend that Brod destroy his manuscripts? The conclusion, as much as one can be reached, seems to be no, that Kafka asked precisely the one person who had already told him he would not honor his wishes. Brod felt too keenly the value in Kafka's unpublished work; his literary ethic overcame his personal scruples, and he devoted much of his life to publishing the writing Kafka had left behind.<br /></p><p><br />Luckily for us. Unluckily, perhaps, for Kafka scholars, the three novels left behind -- <i>The Trial</i>, <i>Amerika</i> (originally titled <i>The Man Who Disappeared</i>), and <i>The Castle</i> -- were all unfinished. Brod heavily edited the manuscripts, correcting Kafka's idiosyncratic spelling and punctuation, reordering paragraphs and chapters, and ""fixing"" their endings, so that they would read as if complete.<br /></p><p><br />The problem with Brod's editing almost goes without saying. It is impossible to know what Kafka's actual intentions regarding these texts were; we have only the manuscripts from which to judge. And these editions faced another obstacle: being banned by the Nazis as ""harmful and undesirable."" Thus Kafka's novels became famous throughout the world largely in their translated forms, particularly the English translations, which present another level of difficulty. <i>The Castle</i> was originally translated into English by Edwin and Willa Muir, whose profoundly Victorian sensibilities provoked them to demodernize the text, smoothing out its jagged edges, straightening its confusions, making its characters more sympathetic, and above all, imbuing the narrator's search with a specifically Christianized spirituality. <br /></p><p><br />All of these arguable mistranslations, along with the questionable editing of Kafka's manuscript, led scholars to cry out for new editions. Even Salman Schocken, Kafka's publisher, was clamoring for critical editions of the novels, claiming that ""the Schocken editions are bad."" Brod, however, made this new work impossible by refusing scholars access to the manuscripts. Finally, in 1961, Kafka's heirs authorized a German scholar who had discovered the manuscripts' whereabouts to deposit them in Oxford University's Bodleian Library. And since the 1970s, a team of Kafka scholars has been working on German critical editions of all of Kafka's writings.<br /></p><p><br /><i>The Castle</i> is the first of those critical editions to be translated into English. This new edition removes all of Brod's editing, returning the text to the last state in which Kafka appears to have intended it. Reading this edition is an odd experience for anyone acquainted with the texts we have always taken for ""Kafka,"" texts that, despite their thematic oddness, have been softened on the sentence and paragraph levels. Mark Harman's translation restores the text's ominousness and its jaggedness, allowing the narration at moments to appear brisk and disjointed, and at others to become caught within the convoluted diction of the Castle's officials.<br /></p><p><br />The plot of <i>The Castle</i> is deceptively simple: A man named K. arrives in a small village and attempts to gain access to the Castle, but his attempts are repeatedly foiled. The story itself is almost unimportant; what develop increasing importance as the novel progresses are the dialogue among characters and the ways in which the story of K.'s presence in the village is restructured every time it's told -- and the ways in which that story becomes a comment upon the novel itself:<br /></p><p><br /> ""But,"" said the chairman, interrupting himself as if he had gone too far in his eagerness to tell the story, or as if it were at least possible that he had gone too far, ""does the story bore you?""<br /></p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote><br /> ""No,"" said K., ""it amuses me.""<br /><p><br />At that, the chairman said: ""I am not telling you this for your amusement.""<br /></p><p><br /> ""It amuses me,"" said K., ""only because it gives me some insight into the ridiculous tangle that may under certain circumstances determine a person's life.""<br /></p><p><br /> ""You still haven't gained any insight,"" the chairman said gravely, ""and so I can go on...""<br /></p></blockquote><br /><br /><p><br />But the gaining of insight in such a bureaucratically controlled circumstance is all but impossible. <i>The Castle</i> is a tale not only of the terrors of such hierarchical control but also of the village's paranoid response to that bureaucracy; the characters reveal over and over again their powers of -- in fact, their need for -- interpretation. K., on the other hand, exists in this world as a bad reader of a flawed text.<br /></p><p><br />Perhaps most shocking about this edition of <i>The Castle</i> are the three chapters restored to the novel's end. The manuscript -- and this edition of the novel -- literally ends in midsentence, as if Kafka picked up his pen and walked away. Max Brod chose to end the novel at its most decisive moment, as K. loses his fiancée. The three chapters that follow, however, while hardly lending any sense of completion to the novel, are crucial to understanding the relationship of K. to both the village and the Castle authorities.<br /></p><p><br />This new edition, by undoing the attempts of previous editors and translators to ""rationalize"" the text, reveals Kafka's project as manifest in his very prose. It is puzzling, even maddening at moments, but infinitely rewarding.</p><p>Kathleen Fitzpatrick</p>"

Q688919,Der Besuch der alten Dame,Friedrich Dürrenmatt,1959,120,12292,137,3.88,"Die Milliardärin Claire Zachanassian besucht die verarmte Kleinstadt Güllen (in Wirklichkeit Ins, im Schweizer Kanton Bern) in der sie einst ihre Kindheit und Jugend als Klara („Kläri“) Wäscher verbracht hat. Während die Einwohner auf finanzielle Zuwendungen und Investitionen hoffen, will Claire vor allem Rache für ein altes Unrecht: Als sie im Alter von 17 Jahren von dem 19-jährigen Güllener Alfred Ill ein Kind erwartete, leugnete dieser die Vaterschaft und gewann mit Hilfe bestochener Zeugen den von Klara gegen ihn angestrengten Prozess. Entehrt, wehrlos und arm musste Klara Wäscher ihre Heimat verlassen, verlor ihr Kind, wurde zur Prostituierten, gelangte jedoch später durch die Heirat mit einem Ölquellenbesitzer (der noch acht weitere Ehen folgten) an ein riesiges Vermögen.<br />Die inzwischen hochangesehene „alte Dame“ hat insgeheim, als Vorbereitung für ihren Besuch, in der Vergangenheit alle Güllener Fabriken und Grundstücke aufgekauft, um die Stadt allmählich zu ruinieren. Nun, 45 Jahre nach ihrer Vertreibung, unterbreitet sie den auf diese Weise für Korruption und finanzielle Strohhalme besonders empfänglich gewordenen Güllenern ein ebenso verlockendes wie unmoralisches Angebot und verspricht: „Eine Milliarde für Güllen, wenn jemand Alfred Ill tötet. [...] Gerechtigkeit für eine Milliarde.“ Diese Forderung lehnen die Bewohner zunächst zwar entrüstet ab, beginnen jedoch seltsamerweise gleichzeitig, über ihre Verhältnisse zu leben, sich Geld zu borgen und auszugeben, und die Kaufleute gewähren Kredite, so als ob alle mit einem baldigen Vermögenszuwachs rechnen könnten. Vergeblich bemüht sich Ill, Claire umzustimmen, seinen Fehler zu entschuldigen und seinen Freunden ins Gewissen zu reden. Es gibt niemanden, der sich nicht gern vom unerwarteten Wohlstandsbazillus infizieren ließe. Der Bürgermeister gibt den Bau eines neuen Rathauses in Auftrag, der Pfarrer hat bereits neue Glocken für seine Kirche bestellt, jedermann stolziert plötzlich in nagelneuen gelben Schuhen wie auf Goldtalern daher, und selbst Ills eigene Familie macht den Konsumrausch mit: Seine Frau kauft sich einen teuren Pelzmantel, der Sohn ein schnelles Auto und die Tochter nimmt neuerdings Tennisunterricht. Sie alle heucheln Solidarität, erklären „ihren Ill“ scheinheilig zum „beliebtesten Bürger der Stadt“ und spielen die allgemeine Gefahr herunter. Nur der Lehrer des Ortes, der sich als „Humanist“ zu Gewissensbissen verpflichtet fühlt, wagt es, die Wahrheit auszusprechen - allerdings nur, wenn er hoffnungslos betrunken ist und daher nicht mehr ernst genommen wird.<br />Als Ill schließlich, von Schuld und Angst zermürbt, fliehen und nach Australien auswandern will, stellen sich ihm die Güllener auf dem Bahnsteig in den Weg, und der Zug fährt ohne ihn ab. „Ängstlich wie ein gehetztes Tier“ erkennt Ill: „Ich bin verloren.“ Wenig später bringt ihm der Bürgermeister ein geladenes Gewehr und lässt es, zum Selbstmord einladend, in Ills Laden zurück. Der jedoch zögert, wächst über sich selbst hinaus und besinnt sich anders. Aus seiner Resignation wird Einsicht und er beschließt, sich seinen Mitbürgern auszuliefern. Stolz lässt der Bürgermeister in der Presse verkünden, Frau Zachanassian habe durch Vermittlung ihres Jugendfreundes Ill der Stadt eine Milliardenstiftung geschenkt. Vor laufenden Kameras bilden die Bürger eine Gasse für Ill. Die schließt sich immer enger um ihn. Als sie sich wieder öffnet, liegt Ill tot am Boden. „Herzschlag“ und „Tod aus Freude“ sind die Kommentare von Amtsarzt und Presse. Claire lässt den Toten in einen mitgebrachten Sarg legen - „Er ist wieder so, wie er war“ -, händigt dem Bürgermeister den Milliardenscheck aus und reist noch am selben Tag ab nach Capri, wo bereits ein Mausoleum auf Ills Leichnam wartet."

Facing hunger, fear of discovery and death, and the petty frustrations of such confined quarters, Anne writes with adult wisdom and views beyond her years.

Q6946506,My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House,Lillian Rogers Parks,2008,346,196,30,4.0,"This is the combined biography of two domestic servants, a mother and her daughter, each of whom worked for thirty years in the White House. In 1909, he mother was hired by President Taft, who was the first president ever to allow a Black person to enter the White House. She worked in the White House until 1939. Her daughter was hired by President Hoover in 1929 and she worked there until the final days of the Eisenhower Administration in 1959. This book should be required reading for every serious student of American history. The authors were eye witnesses to some of the great events of history and offer different prospectives from that found elsewhere. For example, we learn that when Calvin Coolidge announced in 1927 that he did not intend to run for re-election, he was playing hard-to-get. He believed that the people would insist that he accept a third term of office. He expected to be drafted. He actually wanted a third term in office. Coolidge was disappointed when Herbert Hoover was nominated as he disagreed with Hoover's ideas and policies. We learn that in the last year and a half of the presidency of President Woodrow Wilson, he had to be wheeled around the White House in a wheel chair and was often engaged in ""sickbed rambling."" When Franklin D. Roosevelt took office as president, he was an invalid, confined to a wheelchair. Few Americans knew this and elaborate means were devised to make it appear that Roosevelt was robust and healthy. Whenever he was to speak, railings were created beside where he was to be standing. This was done so that it would appear that FDR was walking, taking a few steps up to the speaker's podium, when in reality the handrails were holding him up and he was dragging his feet a short distance to create the illusion that he was walking. Also, Roosevelt was dependent on his mother, Sara Delano, who had all the money and controlled his finances."

Q702957,Flags of Our Fathers,James D. Bradley,2000,376,50588,1307,4.19,"In this unforgettable chronicle of perhaps the most famous moment in American military history, James Bradley has captured the glory, the triumph, the heartbreak, and the legacy of the six men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. Here is the true story behind the immortal photograph that has come to symbolize the courage and indomitable will of America.<br /><br />In February 1945, American Marines plunged into the surf at Iwo Jima—and into history. Through a hail of machine-gun and mortar fire that left the beaches strewn with comrades, they battled to the island's highest peak. And after climbing through a landscape of hell itself, they raised a flag.<br /><br />Now the son of one of the flagraisers has written a powerful account of six very different young men who came together in a moment that will live forever.<br /><br />To his family, John Bradley never spoke of the photograph or the war. But after his death at age seventy, his family discovered closed boxes of letters and photos. In <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>, James Bradley draws on those documents to retrace the lives of his father and the men of Easy Company. Following these men's paths to Iwo Jima, James Bradley has written a classic story of the heroic battle for the Pacific's most crucial island—an island riddled with Japanese tunnels and 22,000 fanatic defenders who would fight to the last man.<br /><br />But perhaps the most interesting part of the story is what happened after the victory. The men in the photo—three were killed during the battle—were proclaimed heroes and flown home, to become reluctant symbols. For two of them, the adulation was shattering. Only James Bradley's father truly survived, displaying no copy of the famous photograph in his home, telling his son only: ""The real heroes of Iwo Jima were the guys who didn't come back.""<br /><br />Few books ever have captured the complexity and furor of war and its aftermath as well as <b>Flags of Our Fathers</b>. A penetrating, epic look at a generation at war, this is history told with keen insight, enormous honesty, and the passion of a son paying homage to his father. It is the story of the difference between truth and myth, the meaning of being a hero, and the essence of the human experience of war.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

The Japanese army swept into the ancient city of Nanking (what was then the capital of China), and within weeks, more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and soldiers were systematically raped, tortured, and murdered. In this seminal work, Iris Chang, whose own grandparents barely escaped the massacre, tells this history from three perspectives: that of the Japanese soldiers, that of the Chinese, and that of a group of Westerners who refused to abandon the city and created a safety zone, which saved almost 300,000 Chinese.<br /> <br /> Drawing on extensive interviews with survivors and documents brought to light for the first time, Iris Chang's classic book is the definitive history of this horrifying episode.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /> <b>""Chang vividly, methodically, records what happened, piecing together the abundant eyewitness reports into an undeniable tapestry of horror."" - Adam Hochschild, <i>Salon</i></b><br />&lt;!--[if !supportAnnotations]--&gt;<br /><br /><br /> &lt;!--[if !supportAnnotations]--&gt;<br />&lt;!--[endif]--&gt;"

Q7085457,Old Yeller,Fred Gipson,1956,132,84526,1748,4.08,"<p>When a novel like Huckleberry Finn, or The Yearling, comes along it defies customary adjectives because of the intensity of the respouse it evokes in the reader. Such a book, we submit, is Old Yeller; to read this eloquently simple story of a boy and his dog in the Texas hill country is an unforgettable and deeply moving experience.</p><p>The big, ugly, yellow dog showed up out of nowhere one night and stole a whole side of hanging pork, and when Travis went for him the next morning that dog started yelling like a baby before he was touched. Then he got into the spring water with five-year-old Arliss, Travis took an easy hate to Old Yeller, as they started to call him; in fact, he would have driven him off or killed him if it hadn't been for brother Arliss' loud and violent protests, So Yeller stayed, and Travis soon found he couldn't have got along without him.</p><p>Pa and Ma and Travis and Arliss lived on Birdsong Creek in the Texas hill country. It wasn't an easy life, but they had a snug cabin that Pa had built himself, and they had their own hogs and their own cattle, and they grew most of what else they needed. The only thing they and the rest of the settlers lacked that year in the late 1860's was cash, so the men decided to get together and drive all the cattle up to the new market in Abilene, Kansas, more than six hundred miles away.</p><p>Travis was only fourteen, but he was proud of his new role as man of the family and determined to live up to his responsibility. It was hard work, too, plowing until his legs ached, chopping wood until his hands were raw and his head was spinning, weeding the garden in the hot sun, toting the heavy buckets tip from the spring, and trying to keep his mischievous little brother in line.</p><p>But there were pleasant moments, too: his Ma treating him like a man, and deer hunting in the early-morning stillness, and hot summer nights out in the corn patch under the stars with Old Yeller, trying to keep the coons and skunks out of the winter food supply. And there was plenty of excitement, like the fight between the two bulls, and the time Arliss nearly got mauled by the bear, and trying to catch and mark the new hogs. Here the suspense and excitement reach a peak, only to be topped a few pages later when the crazy-sick loafer wolf goes for Ma. Both times it is Yeller who saves them, only the second time it is not lucky for Yeller, as Travis comes to find out. And in finding out, Travis learns just how much he has come to love that big ugly dog, and he learns something about the pain of life, too.</p><p>Old Yeller is a story that will be read and treasured by many thousands for years to come. In a shorter form, this has appeared as a three-part serial in Collier's.</p>"

He was a Red Cloud Kelpie, a breed of sheepdog known for its energy and cleverness. But Red Dog was a kind of ultra-Kelpie, energetic and clever enough for an entire breed in himself.<br /><br />Dubbed a “professional traveler” rather than a stray, Red Dog established his own transportation system, hitchhiking between far-flung towns and female dogs in cars whose engine noises he’d memorized and whose drivers he’d charmed. The call of the wild was matched by the call of the supper dish; Red Dog’s appetite was as legendary as his exploits. Everyone wanted to adopt him (one group of workers made him a member of their union), but Red Dog would be adopted by—or, more precisely, he would adopt—only one man: a bus driver whose love life quickly began to suffer and who never quite recovered from Red Dog’s relentlessly affectionate presence.<br /><br />Independent, clever, sly, stubborn, courageous and foolhardy, impatient with boredom and the boring, Red Dog endeared himself to (almost) everyone who crossed his path.

At eleven, Pip Mackenzie's young life has already been touched by tragedy; nine months before, a terrible accident plunged her mother into inconsolable grief. But on this chilly July afternoon, Pip meets someone who fills her sad gray world with color and light. And in her innocence and in his kindness, a spark will be kindled, lives will be changed, and a journey of hope will begin. <br />From the moment the curly-haired girl walks up to his easel on the sand, Matt Bowles senses something magical about her. Pip reminds him of his own daughter at that age, before a bitter divorce tore his family apart and swept his children halfway across the world. With her own mother, Ophelie, retreating deeper into her grief, Pip spends her summer at the shore the way lonely children do: watching the glittering waters and rushing clouds, daydreaming and remembering how things used to be. That is, until she meets artist Matt Bowles, who offers to teach the girl to draw--and can't help but notice her beautiful, lonely mother. At first, Ophelie is thrown off balance by her daughter's new companion--until she realizes how much joy he is bringing into their lives, despite the sadness she sees in his eyes. As their newfound friend works his subtle magic, mother and daughter slowly begin to heal, to laugh again, to rediscover what they have lost. <br />When summer ends, and Ophelie and Pip must leave the beach for the city, the season of healing continues. Gathering her newfound strength, Ophelie begins a volunteer job at a city outreach program, where she works with the homeless, and can no longer ignore the blessings in her own life. But as soul-sharing phone calls and autumn beach getaways deepen Ophelie and Matt's friendship, fate strikes another blow. Out of the blue, Matt must confront unfinished business from his past. Days later, Ophelie is struck by a stunning betrayal by someone she trusts. And as these events reverberate in two already wounded hearts, something extraordinary happens. Out of the darkness that has shadowed them both comes an unexpected gift of hope. <br />With grace and compassion, Danielle Steel explores the fragile bonds between mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, family members and lifelong friends. Her haunting, impassioned novel takes us across the complex landscape of loss--to the blessings that arise from even the darkest tragedies. At once a story of triumph and a moving elegy to those who suffer and survive, Safe Harbour is perhaps her most powerful and life-affirming novel to date. ""From the Hardcover edition."""

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:<br /><br />Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon. <br /><br />Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Q7481191,The Perfect Storm: A True Story of Men Against the Sea,Sebastian Junger,1997,235,103862,836,4.09,"It was the storm of the century, boasting waves over one hundred feet high -- a tempest created by so rare a combination of factors that meteorologists deemed it 'the perfect storm.' When it struck in October 1991, there was virtually no warning. 'She's comin' on, boys, and she's comin' on strong, ' radioed Captain Billy Tyne of the Andrea Gail off the coast of Nova Scotia, and soon afterward the boat and its crew of six disappeared without a trace.In a narrative taut with the fury of the elements, Sebastian Junger takes us deep into the heart of the storm, depicting with vivid detail the courage, terror, and awe that surface in such a gale. Junger illuminates a world of swordfishermen consumed by the dangerous but lucrative trade of offshore fishing -- 'a young man's game, a single man's game' -- and gives us a glimpse of their lives in the tough fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts. He recreates the last moments of the Andrea Gail crew and recounts the daring high-seas rescues that made heroes of some and victims of others; and he weaves together the history of the fishing industry, the science of storms, and the candid accounts of the people whose lives the storm touched. The Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller that leaves us with the taste of salt air on our tongues and a breathless sense of what it feels like to be caught, helpless, in the grip of a force of nature beyond our understanding or control. We know, on the strength this stark and compelling journey into the dark heart of nature, what it feels like to drown."

In the process, the reader is introduced to the Brigadier, Miss Pilchester, and Angela Snow. Setting the style for the series, the book ends with a grand celebration, and the announcement of the wedding of Charlie and Mariette. <br /><br />The novel was filmed with the title ‘The Mating Game’, and between 1991 and 1993, Yorkshire Television produced a highly-successful television series called ‘The Darling Buds of May’. This first book in the Larkin series was very successful, appearing first in the United States and then in Britain, where it sold 40,000 in the first two months. Many critics felt that Bates deserved better than to be remembered mostly for the Larkin novels, but they were very profitable. <br /><br />The immensely popular Larkin series of comic novels consisted of ‘The Darling Buds of May’, ‘A Breath of French Air’ (1959), ‘When the Green Woods Laugh’ (1960), ‘Oh! To Be in England’ (1963), and ‘A Little of What You Fancy’ (1970). Bates, speaking of how he was inspired to create the Larkins, recalled the real junkyard that he often passed near his home in Kent; and he remembered seeing a family -- a father, mother and many children, sucking at ice-creams and eating crisps in a ""ramshackle lorry that had been recently painted a violent electric blue"". <br /><br />He tried writing a brief tale based on the family, but soon decided that he couldn’t waste such a rich gallery of characters to a short story."" Pop is a wonderful character who hates pomp, pretension and humbug; loves his family, but doesn’t hesitate to break a few rules... and his and the Larkins' secret is “that they live as many of us would like to live if only we had the guts and nerve to flout the conventions.""

His missionary ancestors were financially and culturally progressive–one even married a Hawaiian princess, making Matt a royal descendant and one of the state’s largest landowners. <br /><br /> Now his luck has changed. His two daughters are out of control: Ten-year-old Scottie is a smart-ass with a desperate need for attention, and seventeen-year-old Alex, a former model, is a recovering drug addict. Matt’s charismatic, thrill-seeking, high-maintenance wife, Joanie, lies in a coma after a boat-racing accident and will soon be taken off life support. The Kings can hardly picture life without her, but as they come to terms with this tragedy, their sadness is mixed with a sense of freedom that shames them–and spurs them into surprising actions.<br /><br /> Before honoring Joanie’s living will, Matt must gather her friends and family to say their final goodbyes, a difficult situation made worse by the sudden discovery that there is one person who hasn’t been told: the man with whom Joanie had been having an affair, quite possibly the one man she ever truly loved. Forced to examine what he owes not only to the living but to the dead, Matt takes to the road with his daughters to find his wife’s lover, a memorable journey that leads to both painful revelations and unforeseen humor and growth."

Q7731270,The Dwarf,Cho Se-Hui,2006,224,207,16,3.71,"The dark side of South Korea's economic miracle emerges in The Dwarf, Cho Se-hui's enormously popular and critically acclaimed work. First published in 1978, it speaks to the painful social costs of reckless industrialization, even as it tellingly portrays the spiritual malaise of the newly rich and powerful and a working class subject to forces beyond its control. Cho's lean, clipped, deceptively simple style, the rapidly shifting points of view, terse dialogue, and subtle irony evoke the particularities of life in 1970s South Korea in the presence of global economic forces.<br /><br /><br /><br />The desperate realities of life for the dwarf, the proverbial little guy upon whose back Korea's economic transformation largely took place, are emotively rendered in twelve linked stories examining the lives of a laboring family, a family of the newly emerging middle class, and that of a wealthy industrialist. The stories have overlapping characters and situations: the murder of a swindler, a family's eviction from a squatter settlement, the assassination of an important executive, the dwarf 's fantasy of a planet where life is easier, his later suicide and the subsequent fate of his dispersed friends and family members."

  <strong>Country Matters</strong>
</em><br /><br />When Betty MacDonald married a marine and moved to a small chicken farm on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State, she was largely unprepared for the rigors of life in the wild. With no running water, no electricity, a house in need of constant repair, and days that ran from four in the morning to nine at night, the MacDonalds had barely a moment to put their feet up and relax. And then came the children. Yet through every trial and pitfall—through chaos and catastrophe—this indomitable family somehow, mercifully, never lost its sense of humor.<br /><br />A beloved literary treasure for more than half a century, Betty MacDonald's <em>The Egg and I</em> is a heartwarming and uproarious account of adventure and survival on an American frontier."

Q7733605,The Feather Men,Ranulph Fiennes,1994,400,1001,58,3.91,"<i>The Feather Men</i> is the riveting story of the efforts by a private British vigilance committee to eliminate a band of coldblooded contract killers. From 1977 to 1990, three hired assassins known as the Clinic tracked down and murdered four former British soldiers, one at a time. Each of the assassinations was carried out in such an ingenious fashion that there would be no hint of foul play, but one clue these killings had in common was that all four victims had fought in the Arabian desert. Throughout those fourteen years the Feather Men—so known because ""our touch is light""—were never far behind the hit team. Finally, in the autumn of 1990, on a quiet English country lane, the Feather Men achieved a form of justice. Then—for reasons disclosed in these pages—they asked Ranulph Fiennes to reveal their spellbinding story.<br /><br />For many months, <i>The Feather Men</i> has been a number-one best-seller in England. It is a fascinating account of a tenacious double manhunt: the assassins stalking their victims and the Feather Men pursuing the assassins. It is perhaps the ultimate vigilante story, a tale that combines the white-knuckled tension of <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> and the revelatory drama of <i>Spycatcher</i>. And, at its heart, this shocking and intriguing real-life adventure raises the moral question of whether private citizens should take the law into their own hands. ""However, I for one,"" says the author, ""am truly glad that the Feather Men exist, or existed. As to my reasons ... the reader will learn in what follows."""

In telling lies, Laura learns both the astonishing allure of fiction and the social costs of stepping beyond the bounds of propriety, gender, class, and family ties.<br /><br />The novel is only in part a fictionalised account of Richardson's school years at the Presbyterian Ladies College, Melbourne, where (unlike her fictional counterpart) she was not only academically successful but also an outstanding student of music.

What then to make of the <i>cortigiana onesta</i>—the honest courtesan who recast virtue as intellectual integrity and offered wit and refinement in return for patronage and a place in public life? <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/73247.Veronica_Franco"" title=""Veronica Franco"" rel=""nofollow"">Veronica Franco</a> (1546-1591) was such a woman, a writer and citizen of Venice, whose published poems and familiar letters offer rich testimony to the complexity of the honest courtesan's position.<br /><br />Margaret F. Rosenthal draws a compelling portrait of Veronica Franco in her cultural social, and economic world. Rosenthal reveals in Franco's writing a passionate support of defenseless women, strong convictions about inequality, and, in the eroticized language of her epistolary verses, the seductive political nature of all poetic contests. It is Veronica Franco's insight into the power conflicts between men and women—and her awareness of the threat she posed to her male contemporaries—that makes her literary works and her dealings with Venetian intellectuals so pertinent today.<br /><br />Combining the resources of biography, history, literary theory, and cultural criticism, this sophisticated interdisciplinary work presents an eloquent and often moving account of one woman's life as an act of self-creation and as a complex response to social forces and cultural conditions.<br /><br />""A book . . . pleasurably redolent of Venice in the 16th-century. Rosenthal gives a vivid sense of a world of salons and coteries, of intricate networks of family and patronage, and of literary exchanges both intellectual and erotic.""—Helen Hackett, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br /><br /><i>The Honest Courtesan</i> is the basis for the film <i>Dangerous Beauty</i> (1998) directed by Marshall Herskovitz.

Q7753243,The Natural,Bernard Malamud,1961,234,9888,680,3.63,"<b>The classical novel (and basis for the acclaimed film) now in a new edition</b><br /><br />Introduction by Kevin Baker<br /><br /><i>The Natural</i>, Bernard Malamud's first novel, published in 1952, is also the first—and some would say still the best—novel ever written about baseball. In it Malamud, usually appreciated for his unerring portrayals of postwar Jewish life, took on very different material—the story of a superbly gifted ""natural"" at play in the fields of the old daylight baseball era—and invested it with the hardscrabble poetry, at once grand and altogether believable, that runs through all his best work. Four decades later, Alfred Kazin's comment still holds true: ""Malamud has done something which—now that he has done it!—looks as if we have been waiting for it all our lives. He has really raised the whole passion and craziness and fanaticism of baseball as a popular spectacle to its ordained place in mythology."""

Q7755297,The Orchid Thief,Susan Orlean,1998,284,14298,1315,3.69,"In Susan Orlean's mesmerizing true story of beauty and obsession is John Laroche, a renegade plant dealer and sharply handsome guy, in spite of the fact that he is missing his front teeth and has the posture of al dente spaghetti. In 1994, Laroche and three Seminole Indians were arrested with rare orchids they had stolen from a wild swamp in south Florida that is filled with some of the world's most extraordinary plants and trees. Laroche had planned to clone the orchids and then sell them for a small fortune to impassioned collectors. After he was caught in the act, Laroche set off one of the oddest legal controversies in recent memory, which brought together environmentalists, Native Amer-ican activists, and devoted orchid collectors. The result is a tale that is strange, compelling, and hilarious. <br />""New Yorker"" writer Susan Orlean followed Laroche through swamps and into the eccentric world of Florida's orchid collectors, a subculture of aristocrats, fanatics, and smugglers whose obsession with plants is all-consuming. Along the way, Orlean learned the history of orchid collecting, discovered an odd pattern of plant crimes in Florida, and spent time with Laroche's partners, a tribe of Seminole Indians who are still at war with the United States. <br />There is something fascinating or funny or truly bizarre on every page of The Orchid Thief: the story of how the head of a famous Seminole chief came to be displayed in the front window of a local pharmacy; or how seven hundred iguanas were smuggled into Florida; or the case of the only known extraterrestrial plant crime. Ultimately, however, Susan Orlean's book is about passion itself, and the amazing lengths to which peoplewill go to gratify it. That passion is captured with singular vision in The Orchid Thief, a once-in-a-lifetime story by one of our most original journalists. ""From the Hardcover edition."""

Q7756291,The Passover Plot,Hugh J. Schonfield,2004,312,296,22,3.61,"The Passover Plot is a controversial, bestselling book, by British biblical scholar Hugh J. Schonfield who also published a New Testament translation informed by a Jewish perspective.<br /> Based on scholarly research into the culture in which Jesus lived, into the source documents of the gospels &amp; into other literature, Schonfield reached the following conclusions:<br />-Jesus was a religious Jew, well-versed in the teachings of local northern sects such as the Nazarenes &amp; Essenes. <br />-Growing up in Galilee he had a skeptical &amp; somewhat rebellious relationship to the hierarchy &amp; teachings mandated by the authorities of the Temple in Jerusalem.<br />-Jewish Messianic expectation was high in those times, matched to the despair caused by the Roman occupation. <br />-He was both typical of his times, yet extraordinary in his religious convictions, in his scholarship of the biblical literature &amp; in the fervency in which he lived. <br />-He was convinced of being the expected Messiah based on his descent from King David. He methodically attempted to fulfill that role, being well-versed in the details of what it entailed. <br />-He was convinced of the importance of his fulfilling the role perfectly &amp; couldn't allow himself to fail, as that would undoubtedly lead to his being declared a false Messiah. <br />-He was aware of the consequences of his actions &amp; directed his closest supporters, the original twelve apostles, unknowingly to aid him. <br />-He involved others in his plans on a ""need to know"" basis, therefore very few knew of the details of his final plan &amp; even then only the least amount of information necessary. <br />-The culmination of his plan was to be his crucifixion, his resurrection &amp; his reign as the true Kingly &amp; Priestly Messiah, not in heaven but on earth—the realized King of the Jews.<br /> According to this analysis, the events of the Passover, which are presented in all gospels, but inconsistently, are most accurately presented in John. His reading of that gospel convinced him that John's account, tho probably filtered thru an assistant &amp; transcription in his old age, suggests that Jesus had planned everything, viz. so that he wouldn't be on the cross for many hours before the Sabbath arrived when it was required that Jews be taken down, so that one of his supporters on hand would give him water that was laced with a drug to make him unconscious, &amp; so that Joseph of Arimathea, a well-connected supporter, would collect his apparently dead body so he could be secretly nursed back to health. Schonfield suggests that the plan went awry because of a soldier's actions with a spear. Schonfield gives evidence of a high ranking member of the Sanhedrin who was one of Jesus' followers, likely the Beloved Disciple who's otherwise obscure, &amp; notes several instances in which knowledge of or access to the Temple was available to one or more of Jesus' followers. He identifies this follower as John, the source of the gospel many decades later whilst living in Asia Minor. He suggests that this Apostle, &amp; Joseph of Arimathea, were responsible for events following the crucifixion, &amp; that it might have been this 'undercover disciple' who was seen by those who didn't know him at the Tomb on the morning of the Resurrection."

With an engaging new introduction by Gary Scharnhorst, professor of English at the University of New Mexico, this volume is an indispensable addition to the library of American Western literature."
Q7773520,The War Of The Roses,Warren Adler,1981,263,683,3,3.46,"<i>The War of the Roses</i> has over time emerged as a synonym for modern divorce and its emotional aftershock. Since its publication it has spawned numerous film and stage adaptations, endless discourse on the dynamics of divorce as well as becoming part of the legal jargon describing the proceedings that follow. <br /><br />Adler's iconic tale takes us from suburban bliss to an incessant territorial battle. Jonathan and Barbara Rose are at first glance the perfect couple. Jonathan has a stable law career; Barbara is an aspiring gourmet entrepreneur with a promising pâté recipe. Their large home holds the rich antique collection that originally brought them together, as well as the loving familial bond that intertwines them with their children Eve and Josh. When Jonathan finds himself suddenly gripped by what is presumably a heart attack and Barbara confronts the loveless spell<br />lingering between them, the sun-soaked sky that was once the Rose family union drifts into a torrential downpour. Their mutual hatred becomes ammunition in a domestic shootout that escalates in the most unpredictable ways while they helplessly eye their dwindling nuptial flame. In the chaos that unfolds Adler allows a moment of much needed contemplation on the shape of today's matrimonial bonds.<br /><br /><i>The War of the Roses</i> illuminates the relationship-shattering materialism, contempt and selfishness of husband and wife by posing a timeless question, how far are we willing to allow our material possessions the power to define who we are? Are today's marriages haunted by the struggle to get even?"

The Bondurant Boys were a notorious gang of roughnecks and moonshiners who ran liquor through Franklin County, Virginia, during Prohibition and in the years after. Forrest, the eldest brother, is fierce, mythically indestructible, and the consummate businessman; Howard, the middle brother, is an ox of a man besieged by the horrors he witnessed in the Great War; and Jack, the youngest, has a taste for luxury and a dream to get out of Franklin. Driven and haunted, these men forge a business, fall in love, and struggle to stay afloat as they watch their family die, their father's business fail, and the world they know crumble beneath the Depression and drought.White mule, white lightning, firewater, popskull, wild cat, stump whiskey, or rotgut -- whatever you called it, Franklin County was awash in moonshine in the 1920s. When Sherwood Anderson, the journalist and author of ""Winesburg, Ohio,"" was covering a story there, he christened it the ""wettest county in the world."" In the twilight of his career, Anderson finds himself driving along dusty red roads trying to find the Bondurant brothers, piece together the clues linking them to ""The Great Franklin County Moonshine Conspiracy,"" and break open the silence that shrouds Franklin County.<br /><br />In vivid, muscular prose, Matt Bondurant brings these men -- their dark deeds, their long silences, their deep desires -- to life.

Q7775049,The Wind,Dorothy Scarborough,1979,352,109,13,3.91,"The Wind stirred up a fury among Texas readers when it was first published in 1925.<br /><br />This is the story of Letty, a delicate girl who is forced to move from lush Virginia to desolate West Texas. The numbing blizzards, the howling sand storms, and the loneliness of the prairie all combine to undo her nerves. But it is the wind itself, a demon personified, that eventually drives her over the brink of madness.<br /><br />While the West Texas Chamber of Commerce rose up in anger over this slander of their state, Dorothy Scarborough's depiction of the cattle country around Sweetwater during the drought of the late 1880s is essentially accurate. Her blend of realistic description, authentic folklore, and a tragic heroine, bound together by a supernatural theme, is unique in Southwestern literature. As a story by and about a woman, The Wind is a rarity in the early chronicles of the cattle industry. It is also one of the first novels to deal realistically with the more negative aspects of the West.<br /><br />Sylvia Ann Grider's foreword reports on the life and work of Dorothy Scarborough, a native Texan and a well-respected scholar."

Mouse) is thirteen when she is shipped off to Bath Ladies College, a victim of her widowed father’s fears of coping with an adolescent daughter, and of her jealous stepmother. Mouse is a hunchback. She enters the school feeling very much on its margins and is determined never to fit in with the “normal” girls, never to succumb to the expectations of the elder role models: the spinster teachers, the mothers of her schoolmates. She chooses her allies carefully: her hump, whom she calls Alice and who cracks dirty jokes, and John F. Kennedy, to whom Mouse writes long letters asking and giving advice.<br /><br />But the school itself is stranger than Mouse ever could have imagined. Lesbian lore, ghostlike apparitions, and a secret cult of male worship involving King Kong, a dwarf, and the subterranean underworld of tunnels beneath the building all lead Mouse into experiences, both terrifying and exciting, of an alternate reality for her sex. What begins as experimentation, however, spins out of control into psychosis, ending in a death that only Mouse can fully comprehend.<br /><br />Susan Swan has created, in Mouse Bradford, a wise, witty, vulnerable, and honest adolescent whose voice keeps us captivated throughout this dark and disturbing tale. <i>The Wives of Bath</i> is a novel that both moves the heart an astonishes the imagination."

Though eager to please him, Jasira finds her father cold, short-tempered, and occasionally violent. Starved for attention and love, she reaches out to others -- a neighbor who hires her as a babysitter, and a boy at school -- who exploit her neediness to satisfy their own perversity.

It is a desire embodied in the woman he was in love with for five years: the unworldly Sarah, adorable and almost harshly pure of heart—Sarah whose famous death in pursuit of her own uncompromising political ideals Fielding was forced to contemplate in newspaper headlines, even on television. Sarah, a woman so different from the sophisticated and affectionately supportive Juliet—the niece of his powerful political mentor—with whom he lives now.<br /><br />As we enter his world, Fielding (age thirty-four and on the third rung of the latter that has brought him from Brooklyn to Harvard to the Cook County prosecutor’s office as attorney) is suddenly offered a chance to run for Congress. What happens when—plunging into the political fray, drawing on all his will and instinct for victory, thrilled and terrified—he experiences first a vague presentiment and then an unhinging conviction that Sarah is still alive is told in a novel that moves us, compels us, carries us swiftly over the rapids of its outward and inward drama.<br /><br />The twists and turns of a tense political contest whose outcome is increasingly in doubt, the deeper tremors engendered by the schism within the heart of the candidate, and the mystery surrounding both Sarah’s fate and the true nature of Fielding’s commitment to his life and his work—all these elements combine to make a novel of intense excitement, the most powerful, complex, and fascinating we have yet had from Scott Spencer."

Q7993159,Where Angels Fear to Tread,E.M. Forster,1992,147,12973,93,3.62,"Like his novel <i>A Room with a View,</i> E. M. Forster's <i>Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> focuses on a group of English men and women living and traveling in Italy. A young Englishman journeys to Tuscany to rescue his late brother's wife from what appears to be an unsuitable romance with an Italian of little fortune. In the events surrounding that match and its fateful consequences, Forster weaves an exciting and eventful tale that intriguingly contrasts English and Italian lives and sensibilities. <br />As in Forster novels, among them <i>Howards End</i> and <i>A Passage to India, Where Angels Fear to Tread</i> reveals the author's deep fascination with all of human experience — sexual, moral, spiritual, imaginative, material. Acutely observant of the ways of the English middle class, he is as critical here of its snobbishness, greed, and cultural insensitivity as he is respectful of its decency and kindness, common sense, and goodwill. This splendid novel reveals the great breadth of his gifts as both storyteller and humanist — attributes that continue to make him one of the twentieth century's most admired novelists."

Q83533338,Oscar Wilde,Richard Ellmann,1987,648,3177,120,4.24,"In this long-awaited biography, Wilde the legendary Victorian - brilliant writer and conversationalist, reckless flouter of social and sexual conventions - is brought to life. More astute and forbearing, yet more fallible than legend has allowed, Wilde is given here the dimensions of a modern hero. Based on fresh material from many hitherto-untapped sources, Ellmann depicts Wilde's comet-like ascent on the Victorian scene and his equally dramatic sudden eclipse. His Irish background, the actresses to whom he paid court, his unfortunate wife and lovers, his clothes, coiffures, and the decor of his rooms - all are presented here in vivid detail. The saga of his 1882 American tour is recounted with a wealth of new details; also his later impact on the bastions of the French literary establishment. The London of the Nineties, of Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites, Lillie Langtry and the Prince of Wales, is evoked alongside Paris of the ""belle epoque"" and the Greece, Italy and North Africa of Wilde'stravels. Ellmann's definitive critical account of Wilde's entire oeuvre shows him as the proponent of a radical new aesthetic who was perilously at odds with Victorian society. After his period of success and daring, the fatal love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas is followed by exposure, imprisonment, a few wretched years abroad and death in exile. The tragic end of Wilde's life leaves the reader with a sense of compassion and grief for the protagonist. This edition make the popular and best selling biography available in paperback for the first time."

It isn't long before all hell breaks loose!<br /><br />Written in 1889, Mark 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' is one of literature's first genre mash-ups and one of the first works to feature time travel. It is one of the best known Twain stories, and also one of his most unique. Twain uses the work to launch a social commentary on contemporary society, a thinly veiled critique of the contemporary times despite the Old World setting.<br /><br />While the dark pessimism that would fully blossom in Twain's later works can be discerned in 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, ' the novel will nevertheless be remembered primarily for its wild leaps of imagination, brilliant wit, and entertaining storytelling."

Q855801,The Deerslayer,James Fenimore Cooper,1950,544,12823,313,3.69,"<em><em>The Deerslayer</em> is the culmination of James Fenimore Cooper's 'Leather-Stocking' novels, featuring Natty Bumppo (the deer-slaying young frontiersman) and the Mohican chief, Chingachgook. Cooper portrays the hubris of the conquest of a vast territory.<br /><br />The action takes place during the American wars of the 1740s. Natty and his friend Harry attempt to save a trapper and two young women, whose floating fort on Lake Glimmerglass is besieged by the ruthless Iroquois.

Q8565246,Foxfire: Confessions of a Girl Gang,Joyce Carol Oates,1993,328,6978,82,3.79,"The time is the 1950s. The place is a blue-collar town in upstate New York, where five high school girls are joined in a gang dedicated to pride, power, and vengeance on a world they never made - a world that seems made to denigrate and destroy them. <br /><br />Foxfire is Joyce Carol Oates' strongest and most unsparing novel yet...an often engrossing, often shocking evocation of female rage, gallantry, and grit. Here, then, are the Foxfire chronicles - the secret history of a sisterhood of blood, a haven from a world of lechers and oppressors, marked by a liberating fury that burns too hot to last. <br /><br />It is the story of Maddy Monkey, who writes it...of Goldie, whose womanly body masks a fierce, explosive temper...of Lana, with her Marilyn Monroe hair and packs of Chesterfields...of timid Rita, whose humiliation leads to the first act of Foxfire revenge. Above all, it is the story of Legs Sadovsky, with her lean, on-the-edge, icy beauty, whose nerve, muscle, hate, and hurt make her the spark of Foxfire, its guiding spirit, its burning core. At once brutal and lyrical, this is a careening joyride of a novel - charged with outlaw energy and lit by intense emotion.<br /><br />The story moves over the years from the first eruption of adolescent anger at sexual abuse to a shared life financed by luring predatory men into traps baited with sex. But then the gang's very success leads to disaster - as Foxfire makes a last tragic stand against a society intent on swallowing it up. Yet amid scenes of violence, sexual abuse, exploitation, and vengeance lies this novel's greatest power: the exquisite, astonishing rendering of the bonds that link the girls of Foxfire together - especially that between Maddy, the teller ofthe tale, and Legs, whose quintessential strength and bedrock bravery make her one of the most vivid and vital heroines in modern fiction."

His struggle is seen through the eyes of Chief Bromden, a seemingly mute half-Indian patient who understands McMurphy's heroic attempt to do battle with the powers that keep them imprisoned. Ken Kesey's extraordinary first novel is an exuberant, ribald and devastatingly honest portrayal of the boundaries between sanity and madness."

Q861017,The Portrait of a Lady,Henry James,1963,560,72860,1994,3.78,"""The Portrait of a Lady"" is the most stunning achievement of Henry James's early period--in the 1860s and '70s when he was transforming himself from a talented young American into a resident of Europe, a citizen of the world, and one of the greatest novelists of modern times. A kind of delight at the success of this transformation informs every page of this masterpiece. Isabel Archer, a beautiful, intelligent, and headstrong American girl newly endowed with wealth and embarked in Europe on a treacherous journey to self-knowledge, is delineated with a magnificence that is at once casual and tense with force and insight. The characters with whom she is entangled--the good man and the evil one, between whom she wavers, and the mysterious witchlike woman with whom she must do battle--are each rendered with a virtuosity that suggests dazzling imaginative powers. And the scene painting--in England and Italy--provides a continuous visual pleasure while always remaining crucial to the larger drama."

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.<br /><br />""When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood."" <br /><br />So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy-- exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling-- does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. <br /><br />Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors--yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. <br /><br />Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic."

Lecter's a gifted psychopath whose nickname is ""The Cannibal"" because he likes to eat parts of his victims. Isolated by his crimes from all physical contact with the human race, he plays an enigmatic game of ""Clue"" with Starling, providing her with snippets of data that, if she is smart enough, will lead her to the criminal. Undaunted, she goes where the data takes her. As the tension mounts and the bureaucracy thwarts Starling at every turn, Crawford tells her, ""Keep the information and freeze the feelings."" Insulted, betrayed, and humiliated, Starling struggles to focus. If she can understand Lecter's final, ambiguous scrawl, she can find the killer.

Hans Schwartz is Jewish, the son of a Stuttgart doctor who asserts that the rise of the Nazis is ""a temporary illness, something like measles which will pass off as soon as the economic situation improves.""

Q923551,Everything Is Illuminated,Jonathan Safran Foer,2002,276,163708,6078,3.9,"In de zomer na zijn afstuderen reist een schrijver naar het oostelijk deel van Europa. Slechts gewapend met een vergeelde foto gaat hij op zoek naar Augstine, de vrouw die al dan niet een schakel is met zijn grootvader die hij nooit heeft gekend - de vrouw die zijn grootvader, zo is hem verteld, uit de handen van de nazi's heeft gered.<br />Vergezelgd door de onvergetelijke Alex, zijn jonge Oekraïnse gids en tolk die behept is met een komisch spraakverwarrend accent, maakt Jonathan een donquichotachtige zoektocht door een verwoest landschap, terug naar een onverwacht verleden. Verweven door dit verhaal is de roman die de schrijver aan het schrijven is: een betoverende legende over zijn grootvaders dorp, een sjtel, in de Oekraïne, een lappendeken van verbijsterende overeenkomsten die de generaties door de tijd heen verbindt.<br />Gepassioneerd, vol verbeeldingskracht en gekenmerkt door een onuitwisbare humaniteit; Alles is verlicht ontgint de zwarte gaten in de geschiedenis en is uiteindelijk een verhaal over het zoeken naar mensen en plaatsen die niet langer bestaan, naar verborgen waarheden die iedere familie overschaduwen en over de broze, maar noodzakelijke verhalen die verleden en de toekomst met elkaar verbinden.<br /><br />Met Jonathan Safran Foer (USA, 1977) heeft de literatuur er een meesterverteller bij. In zijn eerste roman maken we kennis met de ik-figuur die dezelfde naam draagt als de schrijver, ook zelf schrijft en in de Oekraine op zoek gaat naar een vrouw die zijn grootvader van de Nazi's heeft gered. Al spoedig ontwikkelt zich een vriendschap tussen hem en Alex, zijn Oekraiense tolk. Stukje bij beetje wordt duidelijk welke verschrikkingen zich hier in de oorlog hebben voorgedaan. Dat wil niet zeggen dat dit een zwaarmoedig boek is; integendeel, het boek staat barstensvol komische, dramatische en absurde verhalen die met verbazingwekkende vanzelfsprekendheid worden opgedist, een beetje a la Garcia Marquez. Ook de frequente genrewisselingen - proza, brieven, dromen, dagboek - maken een volstrekt natuurlijke indruk en dragen bij aan de indruk van lichtheid en feestelijkheid die de lezer ondergaat.

Q929165,Malevil,Robert Merle,1975,612,3586,131,4.25,"À la suite d'une explosion, sans doute nucléaire, qui a selon toute vraisemblance ravagé la Terre entière, Emmanuel Comte et ses six compagnons font du château de Malevil, dont la profonde cave leur a permis de survivre, la base de départ de leurs efforts de reconstruction de la civilisation, qui passera également par l'affrontement avec d'autres groupes de survivants, que ce soient des bandes errantes ou des groupes structurés nomades ou sédentaires.<br /><br />La qualification de science-fiction peut être considérée comme exagérée, concernant ce roman, puisque seule la situation de départ (la destruction de la civilisation humaine par une explosion d'origine inconnue) rejoint le thème post-apocalyptique, alors très populaire en science-fiction. Tout le reste du roman raconte comment un groupe de survivants miraculés relève le défi de la reconstruction d'une société humaine. De ce point de vue, on peut dire que le roman relève du genre de la robinsonade.<br /><br />De nombreux thèmes sont abordés dans ce roman : la religion, la politique, la place des femmes dans la société, le monde rural, le rôle du chef, certes sous l'angle d'une mini-communauté mais qui renvoient à notre société."
Q929184,Hannibal,Thomas  Harris,1999,510,89378,2169,3.76,"Horror lit's head chef Harris serves up another course in his Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter trilogy, and it's a pièce de résistance for those with strong stomachs. In the first book, <i>Red Dragon</i> (filmed as <i>Manhunter</i>), Hannibal diabolically helps the FBI track a fascinating serial killer. (Takes one to know one.) In <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>, he advises fledgling FBI manhunter Clarice Starling, then makes a bloody, brilliant escape.<p> Years later, posing as scholarly Dr. Fell, curator of a grand family's palazzo, Hannibal lives the good life in Florence, playing lovely tunes by serial killer/composer Henry VIII and killing hardly anyone himself. Clarice is unluckier: in the novel's action-film-like opening scene, she survives an FBI shootout gone wrong, and her nemesis, Paul Krendler, makes her the fall guy. Clarice is suspended, so, unfortunately, the first cop who stumbles on Hannibal is an Italian named Pazzi, who takes after his ancestors, greedy betrayers depicted in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>.</p><p> Pazzi is on the take from a character as scary as Hannibal: Mason Verger. When Verger was a young man busted for raping children, his vast wealth saved him from jail. All he needed was psychotherapy--with Dr. Lecter. Thanks to the treatment, Verger is now on a respirator, paralyzed except for one crablike hand, watching his enormous, brutal moray eel swim figure eights and devour fish. His obsession is to feed Lecter to some other brutal pets.</p><p> What happens when the Italian cop gets alone with Hannibal? How does Clarice's reunion with Lecter go from macabre to worse? Suffice it to say that the plot is Harris's weirdest, but it still has his signature mastery of realistic detail. There are flaws: Hannibal's madness gets a motive, which is creepy but lessens his mystery. If you want an exact duplicate of <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>'s Clarice/Hannibal duel, you'll miss what's cool about this book--that Hannibal is actually upstaged at points by other monsters. And if you think it's all unprecedentedly horrible, you're right. But note that the horrors are described with exquisite taste. Harris's secret recipe for success is restraint. <i>--Tim Appelo</i> </p>"

Q932306,The Men Who Stare at Goats,Jon Ronson,2005,259,14766,909,3.61,"In 1979 a secret unit was established by the most gifted minds within the U.S. Army. Defying all known accepted military practice -- and indeed, the laws of physics -- they believed that a soldier could adopt a cloak of invisibility, pass cleanly through walls, and, perhaps most chillingly, kill goats just by staring at them.Entrusted with defending America from all known adversaries, they were the First Earth Battalion. And they really weren't joking. What's more, they're back and fighting the War on Terror.<br /><br />With firsthand access to the leading players in the story, Ronson traces the evolution of these bizarre activities over the past three decades and shows how they are alive today within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and in postwar Iraq. Why are they blasting Iraqi prisoners of war with the theme tune to Barney the Purple Dinosaur? Why have 100 debleated goats been secretly placed inside the Special Forces Command Center at Fort Bragg, North Carolina? How was the U.S. military associated with the mysterious mass suicide of a strange cult from San Diego? ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" answers these and many more questions.<br /><br />Ronson's ""Them: Adventures with Extremists,"" a highly acclaimed international bestseller, examined the paranoia at the fringes of hate-filled extremist movements around the globe. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" reveals extraordinary and very nutty military secrets at the core of George W. Bush's War on Terror."
Q932888,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,Aron Ralston,2004,348,19752,1338,3.83,"<b>THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER AND BASIS FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE <i>127 HOURS</i></b><br /> <br />One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told—Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home.<br /><br />It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him.<br /> <br />It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall.<br /> <br />And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that.<br /> <br />What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself.<br /> <br /><i>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</i> -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories."

Q935935,Chronicle of a Death Foretold,Gabriel García Márquez,1983,122,123182,2843,3.97,"Acaso sea 'Crónica de una muerte anunciada' la obra más 'realista' de Gabriel García Márquez, pues se basa en un hecho histórico acontecido en la tierra natal del escritor.<br />Cuando empieza la novela, ya se sabe que los hermanos Vicario van a matar a Santiago Nasar -de hecho ya le han matado- para vengar el honor ultrajado de su hermana Ángela, pero el relato termina precisamente en el momento en que Santiago Nasar muere. El tiempo cíclico, tan utilizado por García Márquez en sus obras, reaparece aquí minuciosamente descompuesto en cada uno de sus momentos, reconstruido prolija y exactamente por el narrador, que va dando cuenta de lo que sucedió mucho tiempo atrás, que avanza y retrocede en su relato y hasta llega mucho tiempo después para contar el destino de los supervivientes. La acción es, a un tiempo, colectiva y personal, clara y ambigua, y atrapa al lector desde un principio, a pesar de que conoce el desenlace de la trama. La dialéctica entre mito y realidad se ve potenciada aquí, una vez más, por una prosa tan cargada de fascinación que los eleva hasta las fronteras de la leyenda."

Q9380292,Children's Island,P.C. Jersild,1986,288,311,0,3.17,"First published in Sweden in 1976, <i>Children’s Island</i> increased the popularity and critical acclaim of its author, P. C. Jersild. The novel, which has sold more than 400,000 copies in Sweden alone, has been translated into French, German, Dutch, and Czechoslovakian. A film was made out of it. The University of Nebraska Press is the first to make available in English a book in some ways reminiscent of J. D. Salinger’s <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. <i>Children’s Island</i> is told from the point of view of a ten-year-old boy, Reine Larsson, who succeeds in <i>not</i> going to summer camp. Reine stays home because time is running out: puberty, sexual desire, adulthood are threatening to rob him of the energy he needs to find the answers to life’s dilemmas. He lulls his divorced mother into thinking he has gone to camp and confronts the task of supporting his love for McDonald’s hamburgers. What he finds in Stockholm—a kind of Children’s Island all its own—is a series of often hilarious adventures that help Jersild define contemporary society. It’s a society of isolation, violence, and aggressive commercialism, a society actually much more threatening to Reine’s psyche and well-being than the changes taking place within his own body. The revulsion he feels for his sexuality and that of others becomes symbolic of the alienation that defines the world Reine grows up in. Robert E. Bjork, general editor of the Modern Scandinavian Literature in Translation series, calls <i>Children’s Island</i> “an extremely entertaining, extremely funny, and very serious book.”"

Q942810,La Bête Humaine,Émile Zola,1977,403,8348,156,4.06,"<i>La Bete humaine</i> (1890), the seventeenth novel in the Rougon-Macquart series, is one of Zola's most violent and explicit works. On one level a tale of murder, passion, and possession, it is also a compassionate study of individuals derailed by atavistic forces beyond their control. Zola considered this his 'most finely worked' novel, and in it he powerfully evokes life at the end of the Second Empire in France, where society seemed to be hurtling into the future like the new locomotives and railways it was building. While expressing the hope that human nature evolves through education and gradually frees itself of the burden of inherited evil, he is constantly reminding us that under the veneer of technological progress there remains, always, the beast within.<br /><br />This new translation captures Zola's fast-paced yet deliberately dispassionate style, while the introduction and detailed notes place the novel in its social, historical, and literary context."

Q951198,Elective Affinities,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,1963,293,7544,139,3.73,"Als Die Wahlverwandtschaften 1809 erschienen, stand Goethe in seiner Popularität weit hinter Frühromantikern, patriotischen Dichtern oder populären Schriftstellern wie Kotzebue zurück, und ein entsprechender Misserfolg war der Roman eines Ehebruchs bis zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts auch. Heute erkennt man in ihm eine radikale Modernität, die sich einem Aufklärungsoptimismus, einer klassizistischen Kunstreligion oder einer romantischen Flucht ins Mythologische verweigert. Der Verfall der ländlich-aristokratischen Idylle lässt sich nicht aufhalten, Friede ergibt sich erst im Tod und Versöhnung bestenfalls im Jenseits. Nicht von ungefähr charakterisiert Thomas Mann die Wahlverwandtschaften als kapitales Alterswerk und »höchsten« Roman der Deutschen."
Q951587,Never Let Me Go,Kazuo Ishiguro,2005,282,466375,23284,3.82,"All children should believe they are special. But the students of Hailsham, an elite school in the English countryside, are so special that visitors shun them, and only by rumor and the occasional fleeting remark by a teacher do they discover their unconventional origins and strange destiny. Kazuo Ishiguro's sixth novel, <i>Never Let Me Go</i>, is a masterpiece of indirection. Like the students of Hailsham, readers are ""told but not told"" what is going on and should be allowed to discover the secrets of Hailsham and the truth about these children on their own.<p> Offsetting the bizarreness of these revelations is the placid, measured voice of the narrator, Kathy H., a 31-year-old Hailsham alumna who, at the close of the 1990s, is consciously ending one phase of her life and beginning another. She is in a reflective mood, and recounts not only her childhood memories, but her quest in adulthood to find out more about Hailsham and the idealistic women who ran it. Although often poignant, Kathy's matter-of-fact narration blunts the sharper emotional effects you might expect in a novel that deals with illness, self-sacrifice, and the severe restriction of personal freedoms. As in Ishiguro's best-known work, <i>The Remains of the Day</i>, only after closing the book do you absorb the magnitude of what his characters endure. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>"
Q952340,The Talisman,Walter Scott,1980,360,2118,1,3.85,"The Talisman is Sir Walter Scott's tale of the Crusades -- a tale of chivalry, of violence, of virtue, romance, and deceit. In Scott's own words: ...the warlike character of Richard I, wild and generous, a pattern of chivalry, with all its extravagant virtues, and its no less absurd errors, was opposed to that of Saladin, in which the Christian and English monarch showed all the cruelty and violence of an Eastern sultan, and Saladin, on the other hand, displayed the deep policy and prudence of a European sovereign, whilst each contended which should excel the other in the knightly qualities of bravery and generosity. This singular contrast afforded, as the author conceived, materials for a work of fiction possessing peculiar interest."

But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age.<br /><br />In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K.

Q97292331,Brick Lane,Monica Ali,2003,416,27956,1478,3.42,"Monica Ali's gorgeous first novel is the deeply moving story of one woman, Nazneen, born in a Bangladeshi village and transported to London at age eighteen to enter into an arranged marriage. Already hailed by the London <i>Observer</i> as ""one of the most significant British novelists of her generation,"" Ali has written a stunningly accomplished debut about one outsider's quest to find her voice.<p>
  <i>What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge.</i>
</p><p>Nazneen's inauspicious entry into the world, an apparent stillbirth on the hard mud floor of a village hut, imbues in her a sense of fatalism that she carries across continents when she is married off to Chanu, a man old enough to be her father. Nazneen moves to London and, for years, keeps house, cares for her husband, and bears children, just as a girl from the village is supposed to do. But gradually she is transformed by her experience, and begins to question whether fate controls her or whether she has a hand in her own destiny. </p><p>Motherhood is a catalyst -- Nazneen's daughters chafe against their father's traditions and pride -- and to her own amazement, Nazneen falls in love with a young man in the community. She discovers both the complexity that comes with free choice and the depth of her attachment to her husband, her daughters, and her new world.</p><p>While Nazneen journeys along her path of self-realization, her sister, Hasina, rushes headlong at her life, first making a ""love marriage,"" then fleeing her violent husband. Woven through the novel, Hasina's letters from Dhaka recount a world of overwhelming adversity. Shaped, yet not bound, by their landscapes and memories, both sisters struggle to dream -- and live -- beyond the rules prescribed for them.</p><p>Vivid, profoundly humane, and beautifully rendered, <i>Brick Lane</i> captures a world at once unimaginable and achingly familiar. And it establishes Monica Ali as a thrilling new voice in fiction. As <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> said, ""She is one of those dangerous writers who see everything.""</p><p><br /><br />2003 Booker Prize Nominee and National Book Critics Circle Award Nominee</p>"

Q978202,Bent,Martin Sherman,1980,80,2416,63,4.25,"(Applause Books). Martin Sherman's worldwide hit play Bent took London by storm in 1979 when it was first performed by the Royal Court Theatre, with Ian McKellen as Max (a character written with the actor in mind). The play itself caused an uproar. ""It educated the world,"" Sherman explains. ""People knew about how the Third Reich treated Jews and, to some extent, gypsies and political prisoners. But very little had come out about their treatment of homosexuals."" Gays were arrested and interned at work camps prior to the genocide of Jews, gypsies, and handicapped, and continued to be imprisoned even after the fall of the Third Reich and liberation of the camps. The play Bent highlights the reason why - a largely ignored German law, Paragraph 175, making homosexuality a criminal offense, which Hitler reactivated and strengthened during his rise to power."
Q978723,Robur the Conqueror,Jules Verne,2002,153,1573,47,3.49,"At the Weldon Institute in Philadelphia, a mob of zealous balloon enthusiasts plans to conquer the sky in a state-of-the-art dirigible. When a stranger, the mysterious Robur, declares that the future belongs not to balloons but to heavier-than-air flying machines, the Institute scornfully dismisses the idea. But Robur demands vengeance and has a unique flying machine that will allow him to take it. <br />By turns an impassioned argument for aviation, a wild proto-steampunk adventure, and a jubilant celebration of the dream of flight, Robur the Conqueror ranks among Jules Verne s most iconic and influential works. Its technological speculations, including the unforgettable aircraft Albatross, are a vibrant snapshot of nineteenth-century scientific innovation."

Q999324,Every Man Dies Alone,Hans Fallada,2000,599,23587,1173,4.24,"Der Stoff dieses Romans ist authentisch. Fallada erfuhr 1945 aus einer Gestapo-Akte vom Schicksal eines Berliner Ehepaars, das mit Botschaften auf Karten und Kanzleibögen einen einsamen, aussichtlichslosen Widerstand wagte und 1943 hingerichtet wurde. Den Roman, seinen letzten, schrieb Fallada ein Jahr später, im Herbst 1946, in knapp vier Wochen. „… seit ‚Wolf unter Wölfen’ wieder der erste richtige Fallada“, schrieb er in dieser Zeit an seine geschiedene Frau Anna Ditzen. Als das Buch 1947 im Aufbau-Verlag erschien, lebte Fallada nicht mehr. Heute gehört der Roman – verfilmt und dramatisiert – zu den eindrucksvollsten und populärsten Büchern des Autors."
